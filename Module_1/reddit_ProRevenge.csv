0,Picachu-I-Choose-You,1597031922,21,1,"I tried to post this on Pettyrevenge, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. Hope it lets me post and hope you enjoy.

I used to live in NJ. Every day when I walked my dog, I walked around the block down a long wire fence. At the end of the fence was a white house. An old lady lived there with her husband and I think her son. The fence and the house were two completely different properties. The nice guy that had the fence had 5 BIG dogs. My dog is a mini Doberman that loves to bark and meet people. Whenever I‚Äôm walked my dog Diesel (not his real name), down the fence the old lady who will be OL from now on would come out of her house and yell at me to get my dog away from her property. I was still about 10 feet away from the end of the fence when she said this. 

OL: GET THAT F*****G DOG AWAY FROM MY PROPERTY NOW!

ME: I‚Äôm like 10 feet away from your lawn.

OL: SHUT UP AND GET AWAY!

D: BARK! BARK! BARK!

OL: AAAAAAAAAAAA!! IT IS TRYING TO KILL ME!!!!

ME: Facepalm ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. He is just barking. Not trying to kill you.

OL: YES HE IS!! IM GOING TO CALL THE COPS!

ME: Ok. I got nothing to do today.

I leaned against the fence (still about 10 feet away) and waited for 15 minutes. I lived in a small town so I should have taken less than 5. After 15 minutes, I walked away and went home. Next time was about the same thing, but she threatened to shoot D! So I left because I had no idea what she was capable of. Now I have a BB gun. Is is a Beretta, or for those not into guns, a sidearm, handgun, or pistol. I also have a real pistol holster that I use to carry it. The next day I put the pistols in it‚Äôs holster, and hooked the holster to my jeans. I wore a coat to over is and because it was cold. Oh ya, one thing I almost forgot to mention was that I painted the orange tip black. When I went to walk D, the OL came out screaming again that she was going to shoot D. She went inside and came out after 30 seconds. One hand was behind her back and used the other to wave me off as she shouted.

OL: GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

ME: What have I done to you to act this cr***y?

OL: YOU BROUGHT THAT THING NEER MY PROPERTY!

ME: I‚Äôm not even 10 feet near your property when you come out screaming at me.

OL: THATS IT!

ME: (I reach into my coat and pull out my BB gun so fast you would think that I‚Äôm the flash.) 

OL: (Runs inside WAY to fast for her age)

She kept yelling at me after that day. I never pulled out the BB gun because i didn‚Äôt hav a reason to. But I got tired of it. So kept walking my D and picking up his poo like I normally do. But this time I put the poo bags behind my garbage cans (Yes they were outside). I did this for a month until I had a LOT of poo stored up. So I kept picking it up and putting it behind the garbage can until I saw her leave one day. I finished walking D and then put on a mask over my mouth and nose. I brought all of the poo to the OL‚Äôs house. Sense the town was small, I knew all the people around OL‚Äôs house. None of them had cameras. I opened all the bags and the mask didn‚Äôt help. It smelled HORRIBLE. I
Spread the 4-5 pounds of poo on the walkway up to her house. I had to walk D a different walk because of the smell. She moved about a year later and I moved 4 years after she did. 

So one might say she had a poopy situation on her hands.

TLDR: Don‚Äôt mess/threaten with people who have dogs. You might get a BB gun pointed at you and a sidewalk covered in poo.",ProRevenge,I can‚Äôt walk my dog? Then say hello to my little friend and have a poo covered sidewalk!
1,Chickennuggies79,1597025467,6,1,"So this happened years ago. I used to live out west and made friends with someone I met through work. Our familes and kids were all very close and always came to each others houses for dinners, parties and get together. When she was out for surgery, I cooked a bunch of meals to take over to help lessen the burden of cooking and our friendship continue to grow. Fast forward a couple years later, my family decided to move out of state and I called her to share the news. She never picked up but thought nothing of it. I tried calling her again to no avail. One day ran into her husband at the store and he told me she was at the car but to give her a call again to no avail. 

We moved and I never heard from her once to meet up for any going away dinner or anything. I felt heartbroken as was my daughter as we never got to say goodbye to friends. A month after moving, I tried one last time to reconnect but the line was cut off and sent to voice-mail. I knew then she was avoiding me for whatever reason and actually had the audacity to block my number and all of social media. 

Here is where I take revenge as I tend to be petty and this whole situation pissed me off like no tomorrow. A few years later, I remarried to someone involved in online comedy radio and had the idea to call her up on the radio line while broadcasting. Of course it goes to voice-mail and my husband left a message along the lines of how she felt about Harambe 2020, asking how she felt about full frontal male nudity and ended it with a FU. She called back immediately demanding to know who he was and he said we wanted your thoughts on Haramabe 2020 and to have a good day. Her husband decided to ask what it was all about and we just hung up. We finally just blocked all their numbers as they they wanted to keep calling and at that point we were done and moving on. Some might see it as petty harassment but I take great pleasure in finally get my last word in, her forever trying to figure out who the hell we were and righting her off forever.",ProRevenge,Treat me like dirt

3,_Book_Wurm,1597033674,6,1,"Not sure of this counts as ""pro"". You be the judge. (TLDR at bottom)

I was hired as an HVAC technician at a local company around five years ago. On the day of the interview, I was asked if I had my driver‚Äôs license and I responded that I did not. I was asked if I could get it, and I told them that I could once I had saved up the money to pay off a child support obligation. (Due to an auto accident, I was unable to work for nearly two years, and the child support just piled up. In my state, they can ‚Äì and did ‚Äì revoke my driver‚Äôs license. But not my state refrigerant license.)

I was hired anyway and paired with another technician who drove one of the company trucks, and we made a rather good team. However, I began to notice some seriously concerning behavior. But before I get into that, let me explain something:

In order to work as an HVAC technician that can transport and handle refrigerants, one must have a refrigerant license. To get this license in my state I had to attend a community college for six months, complete all of the required classes and then take an exam that is administered by the state refrigeration board. Much of this exam requires a thorough knowledge of Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, requirements, and most importantly, laws.

It is illegal to improperly dispose of refrigerant. It must be recovered, reclaimed and/or recycled. This is something that was drilled into our heads. The EPA sternly frowns upon the improper releasing of refrigerants into the atmosphere. Moving on...

The company that hired me was a smaller, local type. One office. One warehouse. Less than a dozen trucks, and no more than twenty employees. Their reputation was stellar, and they had numerous longstanding contracts with expensive, private-community home-construction companies. Despite their reputation, the technicians were the worst type: Lazy and thoughtless. I noticed a lot of little things that were just straight up unethical: Shaking the dust off of an air-handler filter, but claiming it was replaced. Charging people money for a pound or two of refrigerant that was never added. Lots of little, petty things that cost little individually, but add up quickly. But there was one thing that was commonly done that especially irritated the shit out of me: Venting refrigerant into the air.

I mentioned it a few times and was brushed off. I desperately needed this job, so I didn‚Äôt want to jeopardize it. But, I did begin to take notes, and on nine separate occasions, I recorded video on my phone. (Wasn‚Äôt hard to do, either.) I only did this to protect myself in case I was asked about it. But later on, those notes and those videos came in handy.

So, just shy of a year, I was fired because I had not gotten my driver‚Äôs license. They had wanted me to go out in a truck on my own, which would have made them (and myself as well) more money. The thing is, other than the day I was hired, I was NEVER asked again about my driver‚Äôs license. Nobody brought it up. I had been slowly paying my debt off, but had not yet saved up the money to pay all of the fees necessary to get my driver‚Äôs license back.

I tried to file for unemployment and was denied, based on the grounds that the employer said that I failed to acquire a license that was necessary for performing my duties.

Here‚Äôs the good part: The EPA will pay up to $10,000 for evidence of every instance of improperly venting refrigerant into the atmosphere. If you go to your local WalMart and pick up a can of refrigerant for your car‚Äôs AC, you can actually read the EPA statement on the label. It warns that you can be punished with fines, imprisonment, or both. (You can learn more here: https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/enforcement-actions-under-title-vi-clean-air-act)

This applies to everyone. Even HVAC companies. I made a few phone calls, and representatives from my state‚Äôs board of refrigeration came for a visit.

I presented my notes, gave them copies of the videos, and ultimately the company that had hired me and then fired me was shut down. The list of infractions discovered by the EPA after I blew the whistle was rather long.  

The bonus: I collected a sizable sum from the EPA for my evidence. Yes, I now have my driver‚Äôs license and I am now employed with a respectable HVAC company.

TLDR: Hired as an HVAC tech although I had no driver‚Äôs license and then fired because I didn‚Äôt get one. Observed multiple EPA violations, turned the evidence over, business collapsed and I collected a nice reward.",ProRevenge,HVAC company fired me without cause. The E.P.A. helped me get revenge.
4,LisaSKadel,1597091579,19,1,"Okay so I've been friends with this woman for at least 10 years but I have known her for at least 20. Our children were around the same age a month apart actually and after moving back home to the city she lived in and we spent a lot of time together. Let me preface this by saying that she was the type of person who is very entitled and thought that people should do things for her just because she wanted them, for instance she ask someone to borrow $20 from their food stamp card which they used to buy food for their children and when she wanted to use $25 Instead at the register, and she asked the person if she could have the extra $5 and they told her no because they needed it for their children she was offended, even though they were doing her a favor.

Now after I had moved home for a good two and a half years I would give her rides whenever she needed them because she didn't have a vehicle and she had two children, and though I didn't mind giving her a ride every time I would give her a ride instead of going to the one place she said she needed a ride I would end up driving her to 20 places on top of that and using up a lot of my gas. I never asked her to pay me for gas I just was doing a favor for a friend. Then out of the blue she decided to stop being my friend with no real reason although she accused me of using her. Now I have never asked her for anything, at all. In fact I've always helped her out when she needed money rides what have you but I never asked her for anything in return or after for anything at all. I was slightly offended by the fact that she accused me of using her because I've always prided myself on being a good friend and I'm not asking my friends for help even if I needed it. So when she decided to end her friendship with me I asked her if she could at least return to me the video game that she had borrowed from my then nine-year-old son because she had had it for over a year and if she was not going to be my friend then he should get his video game back. She absolutely refused to send it back or to give it back to me and laughed at the insinuation that I should ask for a video game back that was my child's. Anybody who knows me knows that you can do whatever you want to me but don't f*** with my son!! So I pretty much told her at that point that if she was the type of person who would steal a video game from a child to spite that child's parent she wasn't the type of friend I wanted anyway and left it at that. A few weeks later my son and my father had gone out for an afternoon together and my father had taken my son to a a fast food restaurant that she just happened to be working at. My father who is the senior citizen wanted to get my son a treat and when he went up to order it she refused to give him the senior citizen discount. Even though it was only about 30 cents he was kind of offended and her reasoning was that because he told her he was ordering it for my child and my child wasn't a senior citizen then she didn't have to give him to senior citizen discount. What she didn't realize is that my father, who is extremely wealthy in his own right, owns a majority stock in that company. I was much more upset by her actions than my father was and I wasn't having it, ( you're not going to steal my kids game AND deny my father his senior citizen discount) so I complained to the corporate office and in my complaint I made sure that they were aware that my father was a majority stockholder in their  company. A few days later I got a phone call from the manager who was working on her shift when this happened, and a few days after that I got a phone call from the owner and I explained to both of them the situation including the fact that she used to be a friend of mine and that she was only doing this to punish me. I explained to the owner that if she wants to curse me out on the street that's fine but don't punish my father who's a customer and a stockholder to spite me and my child. She was actually in the room with the owner while I was on the phone and I could hear her trying to argue how she was totally in the right for denying a senior citizen the senior citizen discount and the owner told her while I was on the phone it doesn't matter who he was ordering it for, what matters is who is paying for it, and since he was a senior citizen and he was paying for it, she should have given him the discount. She continued to try to argue and curse at the owner at which point the owner apparently fired her. While my intention was never to get her fired and that was really based on her own behavior towards being called out oh, it was definitely satisfying that she did get called out for her behavior and for her ill treatment of a customer who's interaction with her really had nothing to do with me in the moment except for the fact that he was my father. Last I heard she was working on a food truck because she's been fired from so many jobs in our town that most places won't hire her at all. AND that's my story of how I stuck it to the girl who stole my son's video game! As I said before you can do whatever you want to me but don't f*** with my child!!",ProRevenge,Revenge on an ex friend

Me: the anti-hero
Timmy: the villain 
Chuck: my accomplice
Carl: former friend
Kiley: female interest 
Gianna: usage material 

This goes back 18ish years ago. Senior year of HS. I had a friend named Carl who I regularly went to church with and hung out with at high school. He introduced me a kid a grade below us named Timmy. Now Timmy was a fat guy with a short fuse and generally universally hated for being an arrogant yet dumb guy. You know the type, everyone hates him but he thinks he‚Äôs cool and part of the popular crowd but socially oblivious. Kinda like a fat virgin version of Stifler from American Pie or maybe Jonah hill from Superbad. 

Now through Carl and the church I met this pretty little thing named Kiley. I was young and naive but I developed a crush on her, after hanging with her and Carl so often, but I was very shy around her. Carl knew I liked her. What I didn‚Äôt know was that Timmy liked her too. 

FF a few months and it‚Äôs time for the prom. I tell Carl I was planning on asking kiley out. He encourages me to do so. Good friend. He then tells Timmy what I‚Äôm about to do. Bad friend. Timmy decides to sabotage me in hopes to get with Kiley and go to prom with her. He tells her that the reason I‚Äôm so shy around her is that I‚Äôve been quietly collecting her hair and making it into a little dolly that I masturbate to. So I when I went to ask Kiley out she immediately rejects me very publicly and warns me she‚Äôll call the cops if I‚Äôm ever near her again. I‚Äôm crushed and humiliated. I ask Carl about kiley‚Äôs sudden views about me. He tells me what Timmy did. I miss out on Prom and Carl gets distant with me.

I run into Carl at church a week later and I ask him how prom went. He tells me Kiley rejected Timmy and that he went to prom with her. He then told me it was just as friends, but now they were sorta dating. Me and Carl get into an argument then a physical fight at church and I‚Äôm physically thrown out of the church.

Okay. Moving on. 

It‚Äôs my second semester of my first year of college. I‚Äôm still kinda pissed what Timmy and Carl did. More so with Timmy than anyone else. I‚Äôm in business law class and there‚Äôs this girl named Gianna seating in front me. Gianna is gorgeous, Gianna Italian, Timmy is Italian and Timmy likes Italian women. I have something here. I begin to talk to my friend Chuck about what I think I can do. He agrees. 

I find Gianna on MySpace and start copying her photos. I create a fake MySpace profile using her photos. I start adding friends of Timmy and I have this whole elaborate page set up. Looks authentic. I even set up an AIM username. 

Lay the bait. 

Timmy eventually adds ‚ÄúGianna‚Äù to his friends list. Then comes the heavy flirting through AIM. Timmy starts telling ‚ÄúGianna‚Äù all of his darkest fantasies as she flirts with him. He starts revealing the stuff she‚Äôd be allowed to do to him in the bed room, she even makes suggestions which he agrees to. He then grants ‚ÄúGianna‚Äù access to his secretive live journal. His live journal where he talks smack about people at school. Jocks, cheer leaders, popular kids, teachers, principal. He says he‚Äôll beat up people on the football team. That he wants to bang the queen of the hot girls. That the girls softball team is worthless. That all the jocks are stupid. All his little secrets are revealed to ‚ÄúGianna‚Äù. 

What Timmy doesn‚Äôt know is that ‚ÄúGianna‚Äù is copying and pasting all of this, every chat, every live journal entry, etc into a Word file. And this goes on for the entire year. Until the very last day of high school for Timmy. See, Chuck and I printed the word file and went to the local library and made 6 additional copies. Each copy was like 80 pages of Timmy‚Äôs confessions. So a total of 7 copies. Chuck also happens to be in the same grade as Timmy. 

So that night of we stuff Chuck‚Äôs backpack full of copies and I give Chuck specific instructions to drop off the copies around school during the morning after first class. Then to come by my friend Tony‚Äôs house before the final bell rings. See Tony lived behind the school parking lot so we expected to see fireworks once the seniors were let out. 

Chuck comes by and me and Tony are having beers by his pool and I hand him a beer and we‚Äôre all watching the school doors.

Final bell rings.

Timmy is the first one out the gate, full throttle running, crying, beat up, jocks of all types are chasing after him, threatening to kill him. The hot girls are calling him gay and fat and some are even chasing after him. There has to be about a herd of 50 people chasing after him. Something out of Black Friday at Walmart or Zombie movie. He‚Äôs running to his car, he gets to his car, the jocks are jumping on to his car and punching and cracking the windows. He‚Äôs trying to plow through the crowd. You can see he‚Äôs crying, blood covering his face as he turns the corner there are still jocks hanging onto the hood trying to punch through. He speeds off onto the road. Lose visibility of him. 

Me and Tony and Chuck are dying laughing watching this all unfold.

I ran into Carl about 10 years later at a bar. He says to me ‚ÄúI know what you did to Timmy, you know you ruined his reputation right? Whenever people look him up he‚Äôs on a website dedicated to exposing creeps. He‚Äôs been in therapy for years. His photography business could never get off the ground because of what you did to him. He‚Äôs still living at home because of you.‚Äù

I sat there with my beer and took a swig and replied ‚ÄúI simply don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. I haven‚Äôt spoken to Timmy since highschool. But whatever the case may be... I don‚Äôt care. He made poor choices in life it seems.‚Äù",ProRevenge,Long Term Implications

I develop bots for people on Discord (a chat platform for those who somehow don't know).  
One day, I checked for hiring in a developer server and saw a job of making a simple bot for a cafe group. I messaged the owner and got the job. I coded the bot the next day and waited for a response from the owner.  


It turns out that the owner was taking a break from Discord, so about a week later, when she was finally back, she DMed me and I fixed the final bug and showed them the bot. Right away, they said ""thank you for the bot, have a great day"", took away my admin role in the server, and blocked me. However, it didn't occur to her that I might be able to give myself admin with the bot. I immediately set the permissions that everyone gets on join to ""Administrator"".  


I am an admin in a bigger Discord Server, with about 300 members. I mentioned everyone and told them to join this server and of course, they notice they have admin.

12,kibufox,1597054529,213,1,"This is not my story. I was present for it, sure, but I did not see all of it personally. Rather, this is my father's story.

So, some context. My father had a degree in mechanical engineering. Either a masters, or doctorate. It had taken him years to get, and he was very proud of that.  Thanks to his training, he had found his way working for many well known companies; working primarily with the procedures used to make various things.  

Over time, he'd privately began working on an idea that would revolutionize how school and gym lockers worked. See, my father realized that there was a problem with those type of metal lockers. Namely, it was very easy for a person to break into them. What's more, as the lockers were designed, there were multiple moving exposed moving parts, which meant that if a student put too many books in one, or really anything got against the door, the locker could be jammed shut, making it near on impossible to open.

So, for several years, dad toyed with a number of ideas, before hitting on a new design which would solve all those problems. The inner workings of the locker's locking mechanism would be contained within the door in such a way that one, it was impossible for someone to ""shim"" or break into, two, the entire mechanism would be enclosed, and three, it was relatively maintenance free.

Now, at this point, my father was the Vice President of manufacturing, and apparently there wasn't a clause in his contract that said that if he designed anything while working for the company; then he had to turn that over to them for profit.  Dad still approached the company, offering them the design, but they weren't interested. Dad sat on the design for a while before eventually just taking out several patents on them, and then forgetting about them.

About six months after his first attempt at getting the company interested, the parent company's owner/chairman of the board passed away, and the board opted to sell off some of the holdings. The company my dad worked for was part of that.  The new owners were young guys who seemed to think they knew everything (as young business owners always seem to think), and they set about changing 99% of the way things were being done. At some point, they stumbled across the plans my father had designed. Now that's where things turned curious.  They really wanted to start producing this new design, but as they didn't have all the plans and processes laid out for them, they had to turn to my father for answers. Rather than asking him how to do it, or licensing the patents (as any reputable company would have done) they ordered him to turn over all his work; or else they would fire him.  Dad stood his ground and refused. The new owners and my father went back and forth, arguing over details for several weeks, before finally the new owners fired my father for insubordination.

So, on to the revenge. There may be more to this, but I'm not entirely sure if it is just prorevenge. It could border on nuclear, based on what happened some years later... though I'm not certain that what later happened had anything to do with my father's actions.

So, after cleaning out his office, and packing things in the trunk of his car; my father headed home and made a few phone calls. He must have gone through eight or nine different calls before he got in touch with someone who was interested in what he had to say.

See, my dad was under no illusions that the company that had fired him wasn't going to just make those patented lockers on their own. He also knew that though the company itself was relatively small, the owners had money and there was no way he could fight them. However, a larger company could. So he contacted the major competitors and made them an offer. He eventually set up a meeting with some people, wheeled out the prototype he'd made, explained how everything worked and noted that with this system the company could revolutionize the way lockers were both designed, and improve both safety and security. What's more, as he was the only patent holder, for the next seven years or so, that company could be the **only** company to produce them.  

The competitor jumped at the chance and bought all patents both for the design, and the process. They even paid my dad a substantial consultancy fee to go out to their manufacturing site and teach their crews how to make the needed tool and die sets to produce them.  

Less than six months after the first company had fired him, their number one competitor was completely destroying them in the market with this new design... and there wasn't a damn thing the first company could do about it. They did try suing my father, claiming he had stolen their intellectual property, but that case quickly evaporated when they had to admit under oath that they'd never actually signed a contract with him; and there was no requirement that he turn over anything he created to the company. 

In the seven years from when the second company bought the locker design and process patents, they pretty handily moved into markets that previously they'd been unable to.  The first company soldiered on, but by the time the patent had finally expired, they were a shadow of their former selves. The ""new"" owners had sold the company at a loss, with the competitor buying it, only to shut that production facility down due to redundancy. Put maybe 200 people out of work, though given how they'd lost so much business, I wager that it was far less than that.

So yeah, the new guys don't want to play ball, threaten the guy that holds the patents on something they want to do, and then fire him, only to have him take everything to their competitor and effectively put them out of business.",ProRevenge,Don't fire the guy who holds the patents.

Anyways, at the plant that I work at, we all have to wear special projective suits, similar to paint suits. The people who work FOR the company wear a single dark blue suit while all of the contractors (people doing work at the company but employed at a separate company), like myself, wear a light blue suit, although they‚Äôre all the same light blue and they‚Äôve got our company names written on the left breast (like most company polos/button ups).

She cuts me off before I can explain, hands me a mop, and starts yelling at me to start mopping. I tell her no. She does not take kindly to this and gets inches from my face and tells me to ‚Äúget my fat ass mopping or else she‚Äôll have my job quicker than I can walk my white ass into the unemployment office.‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôve had it with this woman and her belligerent, ignorant, and racist remarks. I tell her that if she has such a problem, she can call her manager and I‚Äôll explain to him why I‚Äôm being so belligerent.

She calls him up and says ‚ÄúI have an employee here that is refusing to do work when I tell him to. Maybe you can scare him into getting his lazy ass back to work.‚Äù

She hands me the phone and I go ‚ÄúHello sir.‚Äù He says ‚ÄúSon, you better have a damn good explanation for why you‚Äôre trying to fuck up this account for us.‚Äù

I tell him ‚ÄúWell sir, I work for [my company], not [their company], and your manager on site has confused that because all of the suits we wear look the same. She also had some choice words to say about my race and my weight, which I‚Äôm prepared to go to HR about because I don‚Äôt think that kind of hostile behavior is welcome from a contractor like your people are.‚Äù

I could hear his soul sink when I said that. He said that he would handle the manager on his own but that there would be no need to escalate things further, that I should have a nice day, and that he apologized for the inconvenience. I handed the phone back to the smug looking manager whose face went pale as I assume she was fired over the phone on the spot. She left the plant sunken and broken. I still went to HR because fuck that regional manager too. He was very rude on the phone to someone he thought was his employee and that‚Äôs not how you should preface a call like that. I‚Äôm waiting to hear back on whether they lost the account or not.",ProRevenge,Mistaken and mistreated as employee

15,Buffmoonbrain,1597055079,22,1,"So, I used to suffer from co-dependency disoder with depression and anxiety. I was never co-dependant in a sexual way. There was a kid we will call A. A bullied me rellentlessly but i was co-depentant to him. He put my self esteem lower and lower and lower. Everyone else also did the same. Even the bullied bullied me. So naturally i got worse and worse until i considered suicide. I was saved thanks to my parents finding me bashing my head against the wall in pure depression. I got help after getting the right meds from a psychiatrist and some group therapy. After this all I was left with was pure anger fantasizing killing A; although, i knew i coulden't get away with it so instead i ruined his life in a different way. So there was a kid will call K. K also bullied me but he was fake friends with A so i started to gain his trust to the point he started to trust me and even call me his best friend. I minupulated him into telling me his grevances about A and vice versa A to B. A beliving i was to dependant on him to tell B his secrets it was easy for me to tell them to B without suspicion and me telling those secrets to B he belived that I hated A and I wouldn't tell him his secrets. They both hated eachother an people took sides pretty quicky  (including the teachers) there were multiple full on 5 on 5 fights and i orchestrated it all. A got really paranoid and only trusted me. He eventually punched K and both sides were almost about to fight but i started laughing. They looked at me confused and just like a james bond villan i told them eveything. They where both so scared of me they never even dared talk to me or my real friends.

The funny thing is I enjoyed it. It was fun to manipulate and watch A slowly get more and more paranoid. I felt more powerfull than i had ever felt and looking back at it still puts a huge grin on my face.


Now i'm still in therapy and i'm a pathological liar and narsasist with empathy issues. I've moved schools and i'm a straight A studetn. I have found a purpose and will never let my self or my friends get bullied of hurt again.

19,Breadstix_YT,1597088391,4,1,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this. This story requires a little understanding of the video game called Minecraft. If you don‚Äôt want to read the backstory. Remember, this story was from the perspective of me, so if you think I am wrong in some way please let me know.

I invited this girl to join our SMP Realm on Minecraft on Reddit and she has been nothing but trouble for the past few months. She hasn't caused too much trouble other than jumping to conclusions really fast. Even though this girl has said really disturbing things like ‚ÄúNobody would care if you died‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet a life you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*‚Äù, it‚Äôs important to know that everyone makes mistakes and that I don‚Äôt hate this kid. However, I felt as though this brat had never faced any consequences whatsoever for what she had done. Whenever I address the problem to the server community, I always get a DM in discord saying how mean I was and that ‚Äú*She‚Äôs a girl with a bad childhood‚Äù* I understand that argument, however if I stole something from a store because I had a **bad childhood**, I would still get arrested. But the server admins let her break the rules all the time.

There is a rule that prohibits profanity and NSFW content. However, she is allowed to break those rules. However if a guy puts those types of things in the message board, they would instantly be called a creep and may be warned or banned. The fact that this person can break all the rules she wants knowing full well that they only don‚Äôt punish her because she is a girl had angered me. At one point she was talking about her school life and she said ‚ÄúI punched \[a kid from school\] in the stomach once and he cried like a b\*\*\*\*‚Äù I later asked why she did that and she said ‚ÄúThat school was sexist, they didn‚Äôt care whether or not girls hit boys.‚Äù She used her gender to take advantage of other people.

To butter up all the people with rank, she would send sexual DMs to everyone and also kept telling them stories of how their parents abused them and how her life sucked. This was very effective in making everyone feel pity for her and let her get away with anything. She was the master of deception and twisted my words often. I told her a list of things she should make the most out of her life (because she was on about how her life was trash and that she was a mistake) and she managed to twist my words and say how I ‚Äúforced her not to be sad‚Äù I was tired of getting flooded in my DMs telling me how I was rude. I would say my argument of how she twisted my words, and then them realizing that they made a mistake and apologizing. Then I would say something else to her that is somehow offensive and I would get flooded DMs again. I was done with this, so I left. I didn‚Äôt explain a quarter of the bullying she did, but down below I attached a few photos that show what type of person she is. I made the excuse of ‚ÄúI was bored‚Äù to leave. A few days later I heard from a friend that there was an admin pick and she was chosen (Most likely chosen at random) I decided that I had to get my revenge because this constant cycle of taking advantage of people and cyber bullying has got to stop.

I came up with a plan to grief the eyeballs out of her house. Here‚Äôs the steps that I took to accomplish my goal. It took one month of preparation. Dates are not exact.

Week 1: Since I was in charge of invites, I had the invite link to the discord server that worked forever. I wrote down the link. I deleted my discord account so I can use another account with the same email. I also wrote down the location of her base.

Week 2: I changed my name on Xbox because I was going to destroy her house with the current account. However I thought it would be safer if I simply made another xbox account.

Week 3: I tested different things that I could do. Wither, lava, TNT, etc. However TNT and fire spreads was off. I also predicted when she would go online and offline, since when you‚Äôre up to no good you don‚Äôt wanna be caught.

Week 4: I used my new discord account that I previously deleted to spy on what they were talking about. I also DMed from an Alt saying I wanted to join. This way she would be less suspicious because it is very unlikely that someone trying to destroy a world would wait one week to do so. I used my spy account to see what they were trying to do and noticed that they were inviting people to join the realm. She was talking trash about me unaware that I was watching and everyone else was

Application: The application asked what gender I was. Why would they need to know that? The realm has always had open arms to everyone except troublemakers. I pretended to be a twelve year old girl pretending to use discord for the first time. Since I knew from previous experience that they thought females would never do such a thing and they could trust them. I wanted to teach her a lesson about using gender to take advantage of others.

Here is when I join. I shouldn‚Äôt have been so careless because I walked straight into her base, opened a chest and took everything inside, which was just 20 loaves of bread. I was unaware that an admin was watching me. Right when I took it, I got kicked, which was very fortunate because if he just waited a few minutes, he would have seen me grief and I would have been banned forever. Luckily I made the excuse ‚ÄúI needed food.‚Äù Usually I wouldn‚Äôt get away with that because I already had food on me, but they all thought I was a girl, so they let me off the hook.

Later in the day I decided to start. I logged in right when she logged off, which was very lucky because she was at her house and if I had logged in too early, she would have seen me at her house. Then I destroyed everything, breaking all the chests and burning all the items, killing all her beloved animals (maybe I went too far with that one) pouring lava everywhere and then covering it with water, which creates really ugly cobblestone structures. All the enchanted diamond armor, tools, materials, shulkers... gone. I know how attached she is with her animals, but these are just virtual blocks and items.

I didn‚Äôt want to be too hard on this person. However I felt as if I had to get revenge for all the people who were punched in the face, all the people who she pretty much harassed, all the people who she made cry, all the property she had destroyed, all the kids whose experience playing a video game was ruined, etc. She brags about how if a kid annoys her, she finds all their phobias like spiders, insects, heights, and forces the kid into a situation with one. She‚Äôs proud of what she did! That‚Äôs just wrong.

I don‚Äôt regret a single thing that I did because it‚Äôs really just virtual blocks and items. I‚Äôve quit playing Minecraft with random people on the internet and instead started playing with friends. Do you think my actions were justified? Do you think I‚Äôm the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù in this situation? Let me know.

\*Please be safe on the internet. Trusted friends are safer than random people online.

Wise words of this Kid:

&gt;Legit I was given something I had no idea what it was told me to wear it and when I asked what it was to the main b\*\*\*\* in the dressing room staff she said ""what do you think it is"" in a pissed off tone. She is so lucky I didn't smash her head into that mirror.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I punched him in the stomach once and he cried like a b\*\*\*\* ---&gt; The school was sexist tho they didn't care if girls hit boys as long as it wasn't a girl they didn't like.

21,FantasticToast73,1597170288,34,1,"Let me start this story off with some context. I (24m) moved into my current house a bit over a year ago and everything has been going well aside from one neighbor (early 50s probably). He lives alone and is very rude and doesn‚Äôt seem to be a fan of my mountain biking hobby THAT I DO IN MY OWN YARD! I have built a few jumps in my front yard (the tallest one is only about 7-8‚Äô) but my neighbor has hated them from the beginning.

He began to complain around a month after the jumps were completed, claiming he thought they were temporary. He demanded that I level them, to which I responded that this is my property and there is nothing you can do about it. He seemed to accept that for another month or two until he came back and offered to move them to my backyard with me. I respectfully refused. Again, this is my yard and I can do whatever I want. He then whines about how when I leafblow the jumps (I do this to get rid of the loose dust and make them less slippery) his daughter who only comes over like once a week has trouble breathing due to her asthma. (All of this is on top of his complaints of the unsightliness of my yard).

I tell him the same thing that I told him before, my yard my rules, and he huffs off. However, I do avoid leafblowing when his daughter visits out of courtesy. This is all well and good until COVID starts and his daughter begins to visit every day. They stay out on their front porch every morning COINCIDENTALLY at the exact same time that I want to leafblow. My neighbor continues to ramp up the complaints until he threatens to go to court REGARDING MY FRONT YARD! 

This had been going on until last week, when the daughter shows up once again. She leaves the passenger door of her car open, her rescue inhaler in view. Thinking quick, I grab it out of the car and pocket it, returning to my yard right as she comes out of the house. They proceed to sit on the porch, and I bring out my leaf blower. This is nothing out of the ordinary for them, so they continue while I blow the dust off my jumps. I finish and go inside as the daughter is coughing.

About 5 minutes later an ambulance appears outside their house. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised, but it was unexpected for sure. Sparing the details, he spent the next couple days hurtling insults at me, to which I respond that it was her fault she had no inhaler and that I have been dusting off my jumps for the past year with no issue. He has since moved in with his son, leaving me to my devices with my jumps.",ProRevenge,Neighbor thinks that my yard is unsightly? Have fun at your daughter‚Äôs funeral

I was born to young parents. My dad was 22 and my mom was 20. My dad walked out on us very shortly after my birth and it was just me and my mom. When I was 7, we got a kitten. When I was 15, she met this guy and he very quickly invited us into his home (we never had much money, and lived in the hood while he was the type of guy who would buy a $5,000 TV just because he felt like it.) He had a dog and was allergic to cats so my mom made me give up my cat to one of her dear friends to move there. He worked very hard to make us feel at home and I was very happy despite being a little disappointed about giving up my best friend in the world. He got us a new dog that was supposed to be my dog but he became his anyway. They were trying to have a baby for a while and he finally got her knocked up. Then he became awful. He came up with all these stupid reasons on why I was a bad kid even though I was a fairly good and said if my mom didn‚Äôt figure out a way to get me out of his house he was gonna kick us both out and take the baby when it was born. And he kept saying if I did stay he was kicking down my door and screaming at me and making me do hard labor. My mom ended up having to send me to live with my shitty deadbeat dad who was also awful but was also the lesser of two evils to my stepdad. I lived in a big city with a very nice zoo I had been volunteering at since I was 12 and my mom came to pick me up and drive me there and back on my work days. When I turned 16 I was deemed too old to be a youth volunteer anymore and was offered a job there but had to decline. My baby brother was also born that year. Luckily I got a job at the local veterinarian‚Äôs office. When I was 18 and graduated high school, I was able to go back to my city, get a studio apartment, get a job at the zoo I had been a youth volunteer for, get my cat back, go to college/university there, and get my bachelor‚Äôs at the age of 22 thanks to the money I saved up along with financial support from my mom. I then landed my dream job as a zoologist for the zoo I already had a part time job at. I soon moved out of my apartment and was able to get a house in the nice part of town with my cat and was in a fairly good place financially. My mom resented my stepdad by then because of all the stuff he had done, and I offered to get her a lawyer for the custody battle and come to my place. She said she didn‚Äôt want to have to dump him off there alone every other weekend while he was still a small child. I asked her how old she wanted him to be before she would consider that.

26,Simply_Param,1597113019,2,1,"So, before I begin, lemme give you some backdrop. I apparently live in a colony of affluent people. I'm talking million dollar houses, successful business man, politicians, and even socialites. My family has been graced with a good income paying job for my father, so we live on rent in that colony. My dad's job is in a bank, and he handles accounts over a million, so as a unwritten part, he has to have some class. It is a part of his job in a way. Luckily, I have been unfazed by the money, and I have a very open sense, rather I talk to all the people, irrespective of class, rich or poor, with the same expression. Just a little more help and kindness to the needy. And in our house, we have luxuries, as well as ""Less than a dollar"" stuff, and discounts and cheap stuff attract us, so yeah, don't take me for a filthy rich kid or something. We just happen to live in such a place.

So, one day my mum asks me to get some stuff from the nearby store. So I, unfazed by how I look (wearing nightsuit boxers, with cheap checks, and an over-washed 7$ 3 year old t-shirt, and highly unkempt hair) I just walk out with money in the boxer pocket, wearing 5$ slippers (Just to give you an idea, how ""Out of place"" I was looking). I put on a cheap blue thin cloth mask and walked out.

So the store was like a very small and super-upscale and gourmet version of a WholeFoods, and I just took some random stuff I had to take. While I was looking for something, I heard the derogatory sounding voice of a lady trying to fake an Hindi accent, thinking I don't know English: *""Zara voh saaman dena, Chotu"" (Pass me that thing, ""Chotu"")*

(I'm Indian, and it takes 70k USD p.a to belong to the rich 1% of the country. My dad makes around that amount. In India, [""Chotu"" (literally ""Small Kid/Boy"")](https://translate.google.com/?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMggIIRAWEB0QHjoECAAQRzoGCAAQFhAeULgOWNwbYLIjaABwAXgAgAGHAYgBkQaSAQMwLjaYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#hi/en/%E0%A4%9B%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%82) is mainly used to derogatorily call out to underaged boys doing marginal jobs, like cleaning the table in a restaurant ([A perfect Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieOfXPzRfTk) of a rural ""Chotu""). I was offended like hell. So I, having an English accent of my own replied: ""I'm sorry ma'am, You've been mistaken""

She gave me the 'Checking out how poor you are' look, and said, ""Oops"", and walked away.

She was wearing some designer wear (Tory Burch, incase you are interested) paired with a LV Handbag, and some over-the-top shades. Yes, those ones whom you see in the movies.

I was angry. So I decided to teach her a lesson, in her own style. So I went to the billing counter, parallel to her. The cashier was a good friend of mine, and was aware of my non-fashionable interests. He was aware that I keep no interest in the world of fashion, but do keep information; not to use and test it out on myself, but incase someone asks. So he did see how the lady reacted when she saw me parallel to her, and knew what I will do. He held his giggle, and waited.

""Your bill is for 10$ ma'am"", said the other cashier. So, I knowing that my bill was 3$, said ""How much for the chocolate??"" randomly pointing towards the chocolate fridge. My cashier friend said: ""Umm, 5$ for the bar..."" ""Make it three..."", I said.

So he said: ""Sir, you were pointing towards the discounted or fresh??"" I said ""Fresh, because unlike some people (*slight tilt towards the lady*) who think that buying 3 year old SS17 LV bags at 60% discounts makes them look in vogue, I prefer buying stuff that is new in the shelves...""

This may not be a big deal, but the response of other ladies behind me and the embarrassment lady in picture faced, was enough for her to rush out of the store, and make my revenge worth it.

One of my friends told me to post this here after I told him the story. This all happened about a year ago, when I was 13.
Here are the people involved:
Dave: entitled dad of Carson.
Carson: 13 year old child. Antagonist of the story 
Chad: my friend who told me about ek.
Emma: Chad's friend.
Jake: Carson's right hand man
John: my friend.
(Theses aren't their real names)
It all started back when Carson asked chad to play fortnite with him over discord. Chad (like a lot of people) uninstalled fortnite after it went downhill. Carson refused too believe this and cussed out Chad and called him a b*tch, f*aggot etc. this is his first mistake. Everyone loves chad. He is always nice to everyone and never gets in fights. Chad told me what Carson told him and I. was. furious. I told Carson to stop being childish and grow up for getting mad at chad for not playing fortnite. We bicker back and forth for a while until Jake enters the discord call. Jake is really sensitive and I didn't want to piss him off. So I told him he didn't want to get involved but it turns out Carson WANTED him to get involved. I left the call and went to bed for the night, thinking this would all blow over quickly. Boy was I wrong. I wake up too my phone blowing up with childish insults like ""I bEt He SmElLs LiKe PoOp"". I don't respond and tell John about the incident. John and Carson have had beef in the past so John was happy to get a reason to argue with him. Everyone gets in a call after Chad tells Emma to join. Carson says ""well you can't threaten me you don't know where I live"" John might not but Chad does. Chad tells John what his house looks like. John then scares Carson with things like ""see that black car?"" and ""your house has a basketball hoop on the ground right"" Carson is terrified. He leaves the call and tells Dave(Carson's dad) about everything. Next day Dave gets on Carson's discord account and demands I give him John's phone number. If we don't, ""I'm going to hang you and all of your fucking friends from a tree. I'll make it slow and painful."" he keeps going on with threats telling us about how he wanted to murder us for ""hurting my Angle's feelings"" I hang up the call because when some adult who is 10x bigger then I am, I get freaked out. I ask John what to do. He doesn't really care. Then I remember. If he told me this, but John was the one threatening Carson, then Dave would use even harsher words. This is where my revenge takes place. I call John and Chad and tell them to come over. I text Dave and give him John's contact. Dave calls John. This time, I was right.

36,SociallyDeclined00,1597258578,4,1,"To set the stage, we lived in an apartment for 7 years (me only 3, my fiance the full 7). About a year ago, the landlord sold the property to some guy like 100 miles away. He was clearly using it as a tax write off. We never met him and he was never around. He contracted the local government mandated housing assistance office to submanage the property for him. 
This is pretty common for tax write offs or low income areas/housing. 

Our lease was up August, we were searching for a new place to live as I was pregnant at the time and we needed more space. We didn't find one in time, so we signed for another year. The new landlord did not purchase the property for another 3 months. We moved out in January but continued paying as they wouldn't let us out of our lease.

At the start of last month (rent is due on the 1st there) the property manager form the housing assistance office started harassing us for the last months rent. It's important to note that upon signing the initial lease, my fiance paid first month, last month and the security deposit. So that month was already covered. We explained this to the manager 10 times. He said legal action would be taken if we didn't pay. So we contacted the old landlord, he agreed to testify that we did in fact, already pay.. he even said its in all the current and last leases. The new company has his paperwork, so they know this. But the manager claimed it wasn't there. 

We filed to take him for court for harassment and extortion. Because we were filing against the manager, it was the same as filing against the housing office, which is a government facility. The proceedings were rushed due to the claims and the defense involved. 

To make a long story short, I'll just go over the key points as A LOT has happened. 
- The manager tried claiming there was nothing about last months rent ever being requested upon move in, this was contradicted after our lawyer presented the written statement from our old landlord saying otherwise. Even saying that it WAS in the paperwork. 
- a lot of investigation happened, they upcharged out rent in the last year, we didn't know they couldn't do that in the middle of an active lease. They did this with every single resident. 
- after about 2 weeks of investigations, the manager and another woman from the housing office are arrested for fraud, embezzlement and harassment. They were pulling these stunts will ALL the properties they managed. Around 50, and was pocketing the extra money. 
- the office was shut down and services outsourced to other facilities. There are still arrests happening because apparently this was only the tip of the iceberg and there's a huge embezzlement issue in the entire department=, meaning it has become federal and the big boy government has gotten involved.",ProRevenge,How We Accidentally Took Down A Government Agency
37,dachord,1597270430,46,1,"Years ago back in high school I worked in a retail hardware business, along with a few part time guys going to college. One of our jobs was accepting deliveries from the corporate warehouse. Because the truck was full of merchandise, some for our store, some for other stores, we weren't allowed to go into the trailer. The truck driver was responsible for going into the trailer and pushing the boxes of merchandise onto the rollers where we would then take possession, check them against the bill of lading, and then sign off receipt of the items. It was a smooth process until a new truck driver was hired. He was your stereotypical truck driver; big belly, greasy hair, a loud mouth, and constantly smoking. And he was lazy. The first time he arrived, he told us to unload the truck ourselves, went into the crapper, and stayed there for over thirty minutes. I unloaded the truck, it took far longer than normal, but I was diligent and did not remove any items that were not ours. This continued for several weeks and the unloading process took away time that we could have used putting merchandise on the shelves. The boss finally had enough and called corporate. The driver must have been reprimanded, because when he backed into the loading dock the next week, he hopped in the trailer, set up the rollers, and began unloading. But he was going to get even (his version of pro revenge I guess). When I would grab a box off my end of the rollers and carry it into the warehouse to stack, he would push another box down the rollers as hard as he could, sending it crashing to the floor. Some of our products were glass, so it was possible something was going to be broke. I stopped what I was doing, got the boss, and explained. The boss told him no one was going to sign off until every box was opened and inspected. Bear in mind the average load was around 200 boxes. The truck driver got pissed and drove off without finishing the unload. He was hurting himself by doing so, because boss called corporate right away. We closed at 6 every evening. The truck driver knew this. He showed back up at five minutes before closing time and made many asshole remarks while slow-walking the unloading. One of my co-workers was a good sized country boy who liked to chew Beech Nut tobacco. He finally got so aggravated he spit on the truck driver's pants leg and then told him to STFU or else he'd whip his ass. He shut up, but for the next 3 or 4 months, whenever he showed up there was some kind of conflict. He would go out of his way to make the simple act of unloading a truck as difficult as possible. Fast forward to December. It was cold and the delivery was twice the normal size (Christmas season). He parks, gets out, and informs us his arm is broken and therefore he is not going to help with the unload. I was ambivalent, but my big country co-worker was tired of this man's nonsense. What the truck driver did not know was there was a State Trooper in the store shopping. He was a close friend of my co-worker, who had gone out front to find him and told him about this truck driver. Little did any of us know, in my state you cannot legally drive a big truck unless both arms are in working order (ADA may have since changed this law, I don't know). The Trooper came back to the loading dock and demanded to see all of his paperwork. He then conducted an inspection of the truck. I learned a lesson that day; tickets from State Troopers are expensive as hell. Truck driver got three, and then the trooper held his license and dead-lined his truck until he went to the hospital and got a clean bill of health on his arm. He had to pay for a cab to the hospital because none of us would drive him there. Little did he know, after he left, the Trooper took the truck driver's license and paperwork, stuck it under the windshield wiper, and left. The truck driver came back 3 hours later with paperwork. We can only assume that he had to go to the emergency room and get x-rays. He was extremely pissed when he learned what the Trooper did. He was even more pissed that we were laughing at him and stood in front of the store, waving at him as he drove off. We never saw him again. He either demanded a different route, quit, or got fired, I don't know, but I guarantee he never forgot us and our pro revenge.",ProRevenge,Fake a Broken Arm? I'll Get You Dead-Lined.
38,Nubmuffin,1597244547,143,1,"Obligatory ""english is not my native language, apologies for my mistakes and grammar!"" 

This happened around 2016. I'd (at the time 25/26M) been without a job for a while, looking for a better paying job than I had before and I found one at a camera security company that was looking to hire someone for the servicedesk. 

I went for an interview and got a call back later that day. If I wanted the job it was mine. 

Now, my new manager was an ex military. Specifically ex-army (not american, just pointing that out). He REALLY didn't like having people disagree with or going against him. A thing I was very unaware of when I took the job.

For 2/3 months everything was going well. The manager was cordial and seemed to really enjoy having me there. I worked my butt off every day, as the software we were working with was unknown to me, so I studied a lot and even went oversea to another country to follow a course and succeeded on my exams.

However, after that period my grandpa, who was like a second father to me, suddenly was hospitalized after a brain bleed. (aneurysm?) He was found in the shower, he had collapsed after he pressed his panic button. (assisted living? Not sure how it's called in English, apologies). 

This all happened on a wednesday. The family came together in the hospital several times to show support and see grandpa. However, on Friday afternoon, 3pm I was called up by my father (my grandpa's son) while I was at work and he explained to me that grandpa unfortunately passed away. I was in tears on the phone and in utter shock. It took me a while to calm down. 

I went to my manager and explained what just happened and that I'm going home to be with my family. However, that day there was an event. The company was doing a charity event and this charity was going to be public news. They already announced the amount of people participating and it would look bad if they were a person down. It was basically just for good PR.

So he refused to let me go. I told him that by law he cannot deny me as my contract states I can take a day for a death in the family and that I was leaving now.

This was the turning point. He went from a nice manager to a manager from hell. Suddenly everything I did was wrong, I was told he couldn't believe I was in this line of work for 6 years and be this bad at my job, he cussed me out and ridiculed me infront of my colleagues and even clients. 

This all continued for several months and severly began to impact my mental health.   
I had a talk with my parents and my fianc√© (at the time still my girlfriend, I'd ask her to marry me in December 2016) and they basically told me that this was not okay, that I didn't have to take this and that I should give them my 2 weeks notice. 

I agreed. The following day I went to HR and explained why I was leaving the company and that I couldn't stand the idea of working even a single day more with that excuse of a human being. 

HR showed interest in my well being and even more importantly in what I was claiming about my manager. They had received more complaints about him, but nobody had proof of his wrongdoings. So, they asked me if I had proof. I told them I'd be looking for a new job, but I'd gladly fit in the time to collect all I could. 

For the next 2 weeks I collected everything. Memo's, emails, voice recordings (when on the phone the calls are automatically recorded and the dumbass was stupid enough to cuss me out while I was on the phone, lucky me). Also lucky was that my colleagues at the desk had my back this entire time. They'd been trying to cheer me up, said I was doing fine work and that they also didn't understand this man's behavior. So, when I came by and asked if they'd mind signing a document that everything I stated in the paperwork was the true, they gladly did.

I had one last talk with HR and him at the same time the last day I was there. Before he even walked in, I told the HR person who was mediating: ""He's going to walk in, say what he wants to say and I'll be quiet and listen. When he's done, I'll explain my side and he's going to interupt me, tell you I'm lying and talk about completely none related subject matter to drag the conversation another direction."".

She looked surprised at my comment, but had no time to respond as mister army man, walked in and began his spiel. Exactly as I stated he'd blurt his side out and once I tried to talk he'd consistently interupt me and tried to pick fights.

Eventually I got up, told HR ""I told you so. Here's the documents you've been asking for."". I placed a filled folder with several dozens of emails, plenty of memo's and a USB containing 3 phone conversations and even video footage of him yelling at me, in both voice and video recordings you could easily hear him cuss me out. 

I gave the manager a big bright smile, who was smirking victiorously and said to him: ""I don't think you'll be smirking like that for long. Enjoy your little victory."".

His smirk disappeared into a confused scowl, but I slammed the door on him before he could respond and left the building feeling like a huge and I mean humongus sized, planet sized amount of stress fell off my shoulders. Within a month, I was back to my old self. 

Two months later I was working at a new job and out of curiousity I checked my ex-manager's linkedin. ""Unemployed"". 

I called one of my old colleagues to ask what exactly went down. My proof opened pandora's box. He was being disrespectful to the female staff, insulted the older staff and on multiple occassions was less than cordial with our external hires. None of these complaints were acted upon, because it was his word against theirs and there was no proof.

However, me providing overwhelming proof of his gross behavior towards me made all other complaints now to be taken as fact. 

He was promptly fired less than a month after I left and they refused to provide him with any form of reference. In a field like his references mean a lot. So not getting one from a company you worked at for nearly a year is a huge red-flag. It's now 2020, 4 years passed and according to linkedin he's still not working in his field. 

I'll gladly admit that I felt rather wickedly satisified and still do whenever I happen to think about it.

TL:DR Manager began to bully me because I went to my family after the death of my grandpa instead of staying at work and basically forced me to quit for my own mental health. I delivered an overwhelming amount of proof of his misconduct that got him fired, which made it very difficult for him to find another job in his field.",ProRevenge,Manager bullies me for several months until I finally quit.

41,idkiamnotsure,1597231980,122,1,"So I know this story isn't as extreme as the rest of the stories on this sub but here it goes.

Earlier this week I had scheduled a trial shift for the position of a server, unfortunately they scheduled me on the wrong day and the manager ended up giving me his number to reschedule (important for later)

So I come in a day or so later and I was excited.
I have worked as a waitress before and the virus made it very hard to find a job. And that restaurant was also close to my home!

In an hour or so in everything is great. The staff is friendly and I do whatever I can around the restaurant (which wasn't much, since I couldn't take orders yet)

And then I get introduced to ""Tom"". Tom is about 30 and the assistant manager. Tom was an asshole from the beginning.

He pointed out things I did wrong even when I couldn't possibly have known that. He was passive aggressive and would make rude remarks constantly while fake smiling the whole time.

He would be hostile while having this ""calm"" tone and following every remark with ""just so you know I am so tired and other people would be much ruder with you, it is for your own good (:""

I tried to keep my distance, it wasn't his job to train me but Tom took it one step further.

He started following me around, and whispering ""well at least that's a start"" when I cleaned tables and no one was around. I was beginning to lose my patience.

I figured that I should go home since even if I got hired, my less than average pay wasn't worth the constant discomfort and borderline bullying from the management.

I was ready to leave, told everyone goodbye, thanked them for the opportunity yada yada and honesty, I was going to forget everything about Tom.

But then he catches me at the door and in his fakest mean girl voice says ""oh noo what happened?""
I inform him that I was going home to which he reacts my smiling widely and in the most sarcastic tone says ""Ohhhh nooo what are we going to do without you? (:"" (implying I am useless)

I was speechless. I was never in a similar situation before. Suddenly this man who was 10+ years older than me was trying to make me feel like shit.

So I went home and then I remembered. I had the number! Usually they don't give it to you but well, it was my lucky day.I called the manager that was horrified to hear what happened. He apologized profusely and told me that he had some complaints before and that he was going to have a talk with Tom (and he was getting fired)

I'm also leaving names and troop numbers out for obvious reasons. Now on with the show.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when I was in third grade my dad asked me if I wanted to become a cub scout (junior Boy Scout) because all of my friends were in it. Of course I said yes and it truly was an amazing experience for me and everyone else. Once we were old enough we became real Boy Scouts and every year more people would join our troop. Last summer our troop won a trip to West Virginia for a week to spend at a summer camp, but not everyone was able to go. I got lucky along with my ""friends"" Richard and Sam (not their real names as mentioned above). Most of the week was pretty uneventful, however we did meet up with other troops and Richard became very close friend with a kid from one of them. Richard was an alright kid, but as he got older he slowly became a ""popular kid"", he vaped everywhere, peer pressured others into doing what he said, and was just an all out asshole. After Richard started making lot of friend he started making them all bully me, it wasn't really anything physical, just verbal but that all adds up when there are 10+ kids making fun of you for eating breakfast, but it was tolerable I guess. The worst thing that Richard did was he took his bug spray and a lighter he snuck in and burned our tent on the final day, not to the ground or anything but if one of the oblivious adults looked inside they would've noticed. After we came home from that trip, that same week Richard moved away, I'm not sure where but with the way he was acting i think he knew he wouldn't have any consequences afterwards. Around the same time that Richard left, a new kid joined the troop, I'll call him John. I had known John for a while now and was surprised to see him join the Boy Scouts, him and Sam became very close friends as the weeks went on. In February I invited one of my other friends to also join, and the same week that he joined our troop was going on a camping trip. Since we live up north going on snowy trips happened all the time and most of the time they're really fun. Its important for me to mention that Sam's mother was in charge of our merit badge work and John's father became the head of our troop. On this snow trip my friend had to leave early for a family reunion so we had to take his tent  down earlier than we normally do. During this trip most of the adults were helping other troops get ready for a sled race which is what this camping trip is known for, so while my friend and i were taking the tent down we were unsupervised. At this point in life we're more than old enough to not be under the eyes of an adult for most of the time and Sam and John also knew that. About a minute into taking it down the two of them walk over to us and start harassing us, it started with just name calling and whatnot but eventually my friend shouted back and then all hell broke loose. I don't remember who, but somebody threw a punch and hit my friend in the nose. They then started throwing ice and sticks at us but we eventually finished putting the tent away and i saw John's father so i walked up to him and asked him to just talk to his son, I'm not the kind of person to bitch and complain about stuff but even i knew that i needed to tell somebody, but the only response i got was ""just go do something else OP"". And then it just snapped, whatever thread was keeping me in this troop had broken, i was done. The minute i got home i told my parents that i wanted to move to another troop because of how they treated me, i didn't go into details because i didn't want my parents to worry about me or whatever. One month later and I joined a new troop thats a lot closer to me, the people in it are nicer and the adults actually care about the kids. Until recently thats how i would've ended that story but as of recently something interesting happened, my dad got an email from one of the parents asking him to convince me to go back to my old troop because neither Sam nor John could lead a troop, my dad knew that wasn't going to happen so he just ignored the email. Because John and Sam couldn't lead the troop, less and less kids joined it and it slowly died out. Do i feel bad? kind of. Did they deserve it? Definitely, I'd been putting up with their shit for years as they faced no punishment for it. But i think the hardest part about leaving was knowing that these people I've called my friends since third grade never were my friends, they were just getting close to me to learn secrets and use them against me.

Im not exactly sure where this should go because i think it could go on r/entitledkids but its also revenge and doesnt fit with petty revenge.

Right so a bit of backstory. This happened 4-6 years ago it happened in those 2 years. So this kid we'll call JA (jackass) liked to have a massive ego. He liked to basically say he was going to be an amazing actor when hes older and would use that to do what he wanted (ik it makes no sense to me either). So JA liked hit people for no reason he also liked to think he was smart (he wasnt, not to brag but every year i got 10/10 on mental maths, now i just sound like an a**hole) well he would use this mentality to manipulate some people into doing things/being his friend (the people he didnt knew what he did, seriously my school was shiz) so he has had some ""incidents"" with me and some other friends. 

These incidents include (sorry not in order just what i remember)
‚Ä¢ kicking someone in the face while they were down for no reason, and also screaming racial insults at him (both were white)
‚Ä¢ kicking my shins for throwing a bean bag at him in a game of bean bag tig (im british so i dont know if youll understand it/ basically throw a bean bag and hit they are on)
‚Ä¢ chase me to fight me for no apparent reason 
‚Ä¢ i was walking with my friend and JA decided he wanted a fight and tripped himself up as a reason to start it.
‚Ä¢ would just insult others with racial slurs, homophobic slurs, etc.
‚Ä¢ make fun of my height (i was like an inch shorter than him)
‚Ä¢ he broke his own glasses then blamed it on me (happened after i beat him in a fight)
‚Ä¢ theres alot of other stuff but this post is already getting long.

First fight
So from what i remember our first fight was when he tripped himself over me when i clearly didnt touch him. So we had a trail thing (wood and ropes and stuff that was like an obstacle course that went in a semi circle, there was a concrete part of the playgroung and this was where the grass began and in the middle of the border where this was is a section of brick wall, dont know why it was there) so i then ran because i was one of those kids that didnt fight until i had to, i ran around the wall part until i just said f it and stuck out my arm so hed run into it. That knocked him down and i thought that was it but he got up and threw a punch and missed by alot. (Note i have always had a strong punch for some reason which is why i eventually got into boxing) so i punched him in the face while his glasses were off, partly because i didnt want to smash them and partly because it woul have hurt. And then i got in trouble but because we had the best dinner lady i got out of it as she said it was self defense.

Second fight
This happened around a year after the first one. So my school had those spikey ruber balls that arent hollow for some reason and if you know what they are you know they hurt. He threw one at the back of my head Hard. So i used some less than normal tactics and used my inner monkey to jump on his back and basically choked him (i only did it for a few seconds before realising i shouldnt do it because of the risk) so then i just beat the shiz out of him (this was coming from 6 years of him technically bullying me and because of a shiz school with a shiz teacher who was a douchbag) a lot of rage came out that day. Then he smashed his glasses and said i did it. After this we went in to talk to the teacher told him what happened and he was as good as you could have been to me in terms of the fighting (he knew about JA) but was a complete arse to me about the glasses and even with every telling hizm i didnt do it he still said i did (it took the headteacher to tell him i didnt). So in conclusion it was totally worth it and he didnt do anything since also i know some of you are gonna be like

49,NixxArt,1597207148,155,1,"So, this all started back when I was in Kindergarden. I was just going into the fourth grade and I didn't get along too well with my classmates. They were all really immature and i felt like an adult trying to sit in class with a bunch of toddlers. So naturally I didn't make many friends from my grade, but instead made friends with some middle school students (6th or 7th grade I think) and I got along pretty well with them at first. So anyways, although I am and have always been a dude, back then I was way more on the feminine side. A little too much on the feminine side, apparently. Most of the other fourth grade boys would make fun of me for it, but the middle schoolers didn't seem to care. I thought that maybe I was becoming more masculine, or that they just didn't notice how girly i was. But no, they definitely noticed. And apparently I was so feminine they got turned on by it, and started making questionable advances on me. They'd try to flirt, although not in a cute way or anything, it was just plain creepy. I was oblivious to their attraction, though, because back then I didn't know much about sexuality yet and didn't even know that a guy could like another guy.

Anyways, eventually they started getting impatient. They'd start grabbing on to me and feeling around my body without my consent. They'd tell me it was a prank or joke and that's what bros did or whatever. So I just waved it off and thought nothing of it. Eventually they'd start putting their hands down my pants and start feeling around (without my consent, of course). At this point I started getting a little worried and I began trying to avoid them as much as possible. But then it happened. One day the boys caught up to me. They told me to follow them and that they had something important to show me. Then they beat me up, forced me to give them blowjobs, and told me that if i ever told anyone about it then they'd kill me.

I was in shock for the next few weeks about this and was confused as hell as to what I had just experienced. Eventually I ended up realizing what had been happening this whole time and had a much clearer understanding of the fact that they had just sexually assaulted and molested me. My shock almost immediately turned to anger, and I knew I had to make them pay. Fortunately for me, my parents had bought a new house and we were going to move soon, so I wouldn't be in this school much longer, so I was much less worried about my reputation there. So I talked to the boys and told them that I wanted to be their friend again (ew, gross) and they happily accepted me back into the group. What they didn't know, though, was that I had talked to one of the girls in my grade, who was also one of the only fourth graders i was friends with (I'll call her ng (nice girl)), and i told her what happened and we had made a plan to get revenge. I didn't have my own phone at the time, so she let me use hers, and from then on i recorded every nasty advance the boys made on me, every disgusting remark they made about my body, and every time they tried to molest me. Once I was sure I had enough evidence against them, I was prepared to ruin their lives. Ng used her phone to message each of the boys' girlfriends (Yes, that's right. they had girlfriends during it all) and ng sent the evidence against them and said that each of the boys had been cheating on them with a guy in the school. Originally the plan would have had them knowing it was me, and probably ruining my reputation at the school, but luckily ng was smart and kept me anonymous. Anyways, the girls soon dumped them and the incident spread like wildfire across the school. The boys almost got arrested but since the ""victim"" didn't come forward to make a statement (stupid choice on my part) they were let free. Well, at least free from having to be jailed. They did however get expelled though, since apparently the evidence ng gave the girlfriends was all that the school needed. I never got identified, as my face was left out of the video, and the boys didnt want to reveal who i was since it would have made them look worse. I did however speak in the videos, but I guess my voice wasn't recognizable though. Anyways, I know this story is a bit lame for this subreddit but I just thought I should share. I ended up moving to a new school, and sadly lost contact with ng, but i'm still thankful to this day for her help and support.

50,InterestingBuy4233,1597307548,32,1,"So , I have been having a moral dilemma recently, and it is whether or not to expose a student for cheating.

This student has been cheating for a while, and has been caught on a previous occasion, but now he is at it again. In my school we have a very important math test at the beginning and end of the year, as it determines our placement. We are allowed to use calculators, but only ones which the school has allowed (ti 84 plus, ti 84 plus ce, and ti nspire cx ii (non CAS variant)). Now if you are studying at a highschool level math or know a thing or two about texas instruments calculators, its that the ti nspire cx ii and the ti nspire cx ii CAS, look almost identical. Though, the CAS model gives a significant advantage, over the other models, hence it is not allowed on the test.

Well, this student, previously got caught by having notes in his calculator case, and was given a strict warning that if he did this again, then he would face serious consequences. Though, the teacher didnt realize that the student was cheating in another way, he was using the CAS calculator, but had very neatly covered the CAS logo with a small black tape that camouflaged with the black plastic really well, so unless you look really closely at the top right hand corner, you wont notice it. At the time I didnt care whether he cheated or not, even through the entire grade he used the calculator on various other tests (in which we were again not allowed to use these types of calculators), I didnt care, as it was not going to affect me. However, now I am going to enter my Sophomore year (i dont live in america, but i believe grade 10 is called sophomore), and the class I get into this year will affect my opportunities in my junior and senior year (my curriculum is one where, depending on what class you are in your sophomore year (3 levels, advanced, mid, low) and how you perform you get to decide the class you want to be in for the junior and senior year, advanced (2 different types), or lower (2 different types)). Now there are very limited number of seats for the advanced class in the sophomore year, this wouldnt be a problem if I was going to pursue something that requires a lot of math, but you guessed it, I am intending to take Comp Sci, and well that requires a lot of math.

So, I need to get into the best math class (which has a very limited number of seats) this year, to be eligible for the next one in junior and senior year (assuming I do good on the board exams at the end of this year). So, everybody who wants to take the best math class this year is preparing for the upcoming exam (in 2 weeks), but some people will have to drop down. By this student cheating with this super advanced calculator, he is essentially jeopardising my chances of getting into the class I need to. This is where I feel like the AH, I wanted to write an email to the teacher about his behaviour and how he intends to cheat on the test. Though, as I mentioned previously, he got caught cheating once and was given a very strict warning (not to mention he isn't a very good student, as quite a few teachers complain about him), so if I tell the school he risks getting kicked out or suspended.

I am not asking for advice, but want to know, WIBTA for exposing his cheating?

P.S. I forgot to mention that he is quite rude to me, he has hurtful nicknames like gorilla for me, and doesn't treat me with much respect

About a year ago, my then 15 year old cousin messaged me needing to talk to me. We weren't all that close, so I was a bit confused about what was going on, so I asked her why she was messaging me. 

She was pregnant. She hadn't told anyone yet, and didn't trust anyone else. Our family has a history of doing some sketchy shit to keep one another out of jail, so I could understand. But, I told her to tell her parents, because I didn't think they were involved in any illegal shenanigans. Oh, how wrong I was‚Ä¶

She told me a few days later what happened. That they planned to let her give birth to the baby. That it was ""a miracle from god"" and ""it'd be a sin to terminate the pregnancy."" They refused to tell anyone, not wanting to start another scandal with the family. 

My cousin and I met one last time before she passed. We went shopping together, and she talked for a while about how scared she was. Before she left, she said ""I love you"" in sign language. The only time someone in my family tried to learn ASL, instead of making me write everything down. 

Neither her or the baby survived the pregnancy‚Ä¶

I was devastated. She died before she even turned 16, because her parents thought she could handle childbirth. My aunt, her mother, saw me a few days later. She cried and said how it was such an unexpected tragedy that her daughter had died, and she couldn't believe it happened. 

Finally, the funeral came. She didn't mention a thing about the pregnancy, and just said my cousin had succumbed to some other sickness. I can't remember what it was, I was so angry. Then, after the funeral, my uncle gave me my cousin's laptop. He said ""she wanted you to have it.""

Oh, thank God she did. 

When I got to my home, I started looking through it. Just wanted to see what she did before I erased everything. Then, I saw a document on it named after me. 

It contained everything. How her mother manipulated her into keeping the baby, how her father threatened her into keeping quiet, and‚Ä¶ how my aunt and uncle sometimes blackmailed members of my family to do what they wanted. 

I first wanted to turn it in to the police. But I figured that wouldn't be enough. I wanted to make my aunt and uncle the most hated members of my family. 

So, I emailed this document to everyone who's email address I knew. 

The effects have been catastrophic. A lot of my family shuns my aunt, some side with her, and my family has overall been ripped in half by all this. The pregnancy, plus the blackmail, has made this the biggest scandal the family's seen.",ProRevenge,Let her die? Kiss the family goodbye

59,liamtheawesomeeeee,1597328363,1,1,"My first time post. English is not my 1st language. On mobile phone. Sorry in advance.

Happened to me just now. I went to the supermarket with the prudence dictated by the new normal. Mask, Safe entry and safety distance. (In my country this step is taken seriously by all citizen.)

I then started to get the things that were on my short list, and when I was lining up to pay, between taking the money and storing the phone, the 50 note of my country's currency I had to pay fell on the floor, and the man who was in front of me finishing paying his purchases slowly bent down and picked up my note.

Woww, How much education and kindness in these pandemic times - I thought. I held out my hand, waiting for him to give me back my money, trying to stay away, so that he would feel safe, while preparing to thank him for the gesture.

But suddenly, what he told me was shocking - What's on the floor belongs to whoever finds it! - and just like that, he left ... naturally, as if he hadn't done anything wrong.

I looked at the lady behind me and the people next to me and they all looked at me in shock and disbelief, whispering things between them.

For a moment there, I was trying to evaluate myself. I wanted to do justice on my own ... I left my purchases, because I had no way to pay (I forgot to bring my credit card), and went after him to the carpark, to have my 50 bucks returned.

However, I realized that the people closest to the line came after me, curious to know what was going to happen ...

I spoke to him demanding my money but he just looked at me with contempt and acted like I was invisible.

When he got to the car, he slowly put his four shopping bags on the floor to take the key out of his pocket and open the trunk, and I thought - It's now or never!

I took the four bags and told him the same thing he had said to me - What is on the floor belongs to those who find it! - and I started running towards the exit, between fright and laughter, proud of my revenge.

The spectators started to applaud and I saw that the ‚Äúsmart guy‚Äù had been irritated after all, as he left the parking lot dropping security cones in his path.

I swear I felt a rush of adrenaline, fright and nervousness, but then I cried with laughter.

When I got home I opened the bags and found:
- 2 kg XL prawn
- 1 kg of salmon
- 2 box of Aachi biryani masala
- 1 jar of Nuttela
- 5 tube C≈ïeam cheese
- 10 kg of basmathi rice
- 1 jar of mayonnaise

For some backstory this was back in 2015 and I was in 6th grade. I used to attend ALOHA (it's a international organisation that teaches techniques to do large and simple calculations with your hand very quickly to kids) back then.   
I came first at the national competition that year in my level and they offered to pay the travel expenses of the first position of each level if they wanted participate in the international competition that year. Me and my parents went. 

I was a pretty weird kid back then some would say. I had never had something to play video games on. My parents wouldn't let me use the PC we had. I was only able to play games whenever I went over to my friends house. 

Now, my parents promised me if I won anything at international competition, I'd be getting a Xbox One. I have never been more excited. We flew to Philippines for the competition and everything went as normal. AND YES I GOT SECOND PLACE.  I wanted to scream out of excitement.

We went to a mall the next day for exploring, souvenirs and getting me my Xbox. Or so I had thought. We did the normal tourist stuff. But we went by the shop which had console and other stuff and they seemed to be oblivious about. I decided to ask my parents about it and well what they replied, that was pretty crushing for me. Here's somewhat how it went

  
Me: Mom, dad. When are we gonna buy my Xbox  
Mom: Well, about that. I don't think you're gonna be getting a Xbox  
Dad: Yeah, you came first at the national competition but not at the international one  
Mom: Thinking about it must've distracted you  
Me: \*already sobbing\* but-  
Mom: I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe next year when you get first place

I was devastated. I was looking forward to this a lot. They offered to buy me some toys, but I refused.

We all fly back. Some called to congratulate me and some even visited. This is when my awesome Uncle visited. I really liked him and he could tell I was acting a bit weird. He asked me what happened and I bawled like a baby and told him everything. I guess he felt bad and decided to give me his Xbox One . He had a Xbox One and got a PS4 recently.

When told me that, I hugged him and cried. He had a argument with my parents, but he convinced them finally. I'm still grateful to him for that. He also gave me the games he bought so that I wouldn't have ask my parents :P. Hope you guys enjoyed this bittersweet story of mine.",ProRevenge,My superhero uncle
65,Firest0rmRekT,1597431822,5,1,"Karen owns a beauty centre which does slimming treatments. Since her team was lacking someone with video skills, they were looking for someone to help them piece videos for in-house display and my friend decided to pass her my contact (was a freelancer back then). The deal was initially simple: she passes me a few video clips and animations, my job was to edit the best cuts into one video clip showcasing how the treatment works. I went down to her shop to transfer the videos to my computer since she had minimal technology knowledge (nope, email was a foreign concept to her). Since it was a small business and it was a friend's referral, I decided to charge her a cheap price of 100 bucks for piecing the video clip (&lt;5 mins). ( Yes fellow freelancers, I understand the outrage but there was no coverage, camera equipment or event logistics) 

Turns out that Karen was an ambitious woman who wanted to establish an online presence for her slimming centre. She decided to engage me further in: Product Photography, Graphic Design, Video Interviews for Customer Review and Instagram Management. The problem was, she made all arrangements and changes via verbal communication. That woman called me promptly at 9am in the morning for almost 2 weeks, discussing her plans for a solid hour. While there was alot of talk for HER plans, she kept brushing away my discussion for extra charges. 

Essentially I was doing so much shit for a mere 100 bucks. I created and managed her business instagram account, created 2 weeks of postings and did a photog shoot for her wellness products and treatments (150 edited images). She milked it even further by bringing in a profile shoot with her 3 assistants. Oh and did I mentioned, the video clips she initially gave me were frm CDs of 2003, I had to hunt down videos from youtube and request for permission for use. 

Karen always wanted things to go her way. Despite explaining to her the relevant steps involved in image resharing and that content had to be of decent quality, she insisted on ""keeping the posts going"". She posted past insta-stories as normal profile posts and even uploaded an image of her personal beautician certification on the business IG page. There were times where there were 3 posts released in the same hour. When questioned, she claimed that there was nothing wrong with a ""personal touch"". No Karen, ""personal touch"" does not equate to being informal. You do not tell another influencer about your marital affairs or the fact that your kid ran away from home. Not on a business'es social media page and definitely not while pretending to be me. 

It was close to 2 months before I ended the engagement. I ignored her calls for a week to focus on finishing the first video and to edit the images. Forget about reaching out to prospective beauty influencers, why help your business if you ain't gonna pay me properly? Also, turns out that she wasn't even a real friend of that friend who passed her my contact. That friend only went to the beauty centre for a free trial, thankfully redeeming my faith for friend referrals as she was never a friend of a friend. 

Eventually, I sent her a message that I wasn't able to continue with this project. Her refusal to discuss an official contract to lay down the deliverables and to provide the proper payment for my services was enough of a red flag to stop my efforts. In response, she called me up and said that she's removing her payroll assistance so that she can allocate her monthly salary of 2000 to me instead. She even added that she would make my role permanent ""so that I wouldn't need to worry about job hunting."" It was a definite no from me. But being the kind hearted person back then, I left her with the final video clip and edited images, a lot of content for her use. But being the IT idiot she was, she made one final request for me to come down to her store to help transfer the file into a thumbdrive. I almost fainted. It was most likely an attempt to physically convince me to continue the work, I dumped the contents onto google drive and linked it to her. (Also, what's so hard about using a thumbdrive?)

I was emotionally exhausted from dealing with her. I even had to take a break from freelancing assignments for a good 3 months before committing myself to anything. I felt cheated of my time and effort, I did so much work for fuck all. 

I confided to my family and friends, some that I forgot, were freelancers themselves, indirectly letting the word out to other freelancers, media companies and the marketing firms I worked with. I attempted to bring this case to the trade union since I had evidence, voice recordings(I recorded our calls during the 2nd month) and even screenshots of her exchanges to prospective influencers. Alas without a physical contract, there was nothing much they could do. 

Although my fellow freelancers and I understood the norms of high expectations for clients, they all agreed that Karen was being both unrealistic and unreasonable for many cases. In communities like this, word travels fast. To the point that someone actually sent me a screenshot of her business email (I also created that for her), requesting for creative services at a budget of 100 dollars. Their firm received ""frequent calls in the morning"" as well, with one asking how to place cropped images side by side on instagram. 

6 months later, a friend who works at a marketing firm sends me a screenshot of her business page. She's successfully made the business page all about her with the recurring words ""strong woman"", ""mom-preneur"" and ""dailyhustle"". In this case, personal touch has gone horribly wrong. I'll give it to her that the page has grown to have 400 followers but 50% of the posts are her selfies and a motivational quote. The profile image is now her face instead of the business logo. Well, the IG page is now the way she wanted, slathered in a sea of purple (her favourite colour).

This guys son was one of the laziest people we had out on the floor, he‚Äôd strut around, tell someone to do something, then walk away and roll his shoulders like he was king fucking Farouk. 

Boss asks me to clean out my office and tells me I‚Äôll be ok, I‚Äôll land on my feet he says. I got up to walk out of the office and don‚Äôt even go to my office, I have nothing of value to pack up. I just leave, throw the canned ham into the garbage and fucking fired up the grand national and laid down a huge line of rubber as I peeled out of the parking lot. 

So I‚Äôm at home stewing over this, I‚Äôm really bitter, my boss was leading me on, praising my job, telling me he could see me running the place some day. A few days later I found out from one of my ex co-workers, the bosses son got his girlfriend pregnant, they were gonna get married and wanted to be able to buy a house and start a family. So his big post graduation plans of moving to a bigger city and conquering the world got squashed by his stupidity of not knowing how to ‚Äòpull out‚Äô or even just wrap his jimmy. Fucking pathetic loser. 

So i hatched a plan to get even. I was an outdoorsman type of guy, hunter, camper, fisherman, and knew my way around sporting goods stores. I knew that there was this product you could buy, concentrated liquid skunk scent in a bottle. Well I purchased up a dozen of those bottles, the guy working the store was scratching his head, I just told him I was stocking up and the price seemed right. 

I got home, found a few mason jars and proceeded to carefully pour the bottles of liquid skunk into the mason jars and capped them off. With the backpack loaded, I waited until 1am and went to the warehouse. I got up into the roof where their were three swamp coolers that were used to bring cool air into the offices on hot days. We didn‚Äôt have HVAC and on humid and hot days these things were worthless, but now these bad boys were going to work to my advantage. I opened up the side panels of each swamp cooler and poured my liquid skunk into the water reservoirs each unit and put the panels back on and quickly escaped. 

The next day as the afternoon started to warm up, and the swamp coolers were turned on, that is when all hell broke loose. The workers, the owners and the new manager couldn‚Äôt be in the warehouse for more then a minute without gagging. They tried airing the place out by opening the bay doors but the smell was permeating into everything. The swamp coolers basically blow out humid air, and carried with it that liquid skunk and it just soaked into everything. 

They had to shut down the warehouse. They called in an exterminator who eventually tracked the odor to the swamp coolers. They had to drain out the water, scrub them clean, replace all the pads and let everything dry out and air out for a week. 

I understand almost all the workers told the owner they were going to walk and find other jobs so he paid them their weekly wage, I feel happy about that knowing the workers weren‚Äôt harmed. Two of them were good friends and that week we spent a 3 day weekend fishing and drinking beers and laughing about it. They tried to get me to admit I done it, but I just laughed and said, I sure wish I had thought of it, but no it wasn‚Äôt me. I turned it around and said it was probably one of you fuckers that done it so you could go fishing. 

Over the years I learned that the boss and his son opened three more plants and expanded their operations, but then after the boss retired, the son ran the business into the ground within 10 years and all three plants closed down. I also learned that his wife divorced him and he lives in a shitty little apartment in a run down area of town. 

Yeah so fuck that family, they got what they deserved.",ProRevenge,"Boss gave me a canned ham, a pat on the back, thanked me for my dedication and fired me so his recently graduated son could take my position. So I pro revenged and skunked you‚Äôre business forcing you to close your doors for a week."
78,OrangeCrush252,1597503221,37,1,"For about a year now our son has been going to an in- home daycare that is about 3 minutes from our house. It all started well, there was only about 4 children total (including the babysitters) so it was a small little daycare. However, the daycare started to grow over the year and our babysitter took in 4 more children; due to state regulations she had to hire on another sitter and then she decided to raise her prices... what started at 200 a week went up to 250. She continued to ask for more money to buy more and more toys and outdoor supplies for kids, even to the point where she Venmo'd my wife and me 400 dollars extra to help her buy an outdoor swingset for the kids. Mind you, we're both teachers and still paying medical bills for our 3 month old who she is watching. 

Fast forward through the year and our son is now a year old and walking pretty well for his age.  We put a baby gate up in our house, but I also taught him how to go down the stairs sliding backwards on his stomach. I go to pick him up after work one day and notice the ENTIRE right side of his face is one big bruise and ask why he has a black eye. She told me that she was practicing them going down the stairs and he decided to stand up and try to walk down and feel down the flight of stairs (they have a split level house so there's about 10 stairs my son crashed down). She then hands him to me, no paper work or incident report filled out, didn't call the doctor or anything, and tells me I have to take him to the doctor to get him checked out before he can return the next day. 

I was pretty furious at this point, but unfortunately no other daycares had open spots, so he would have to go back. The doctor checked him out and said everything was good and cleared him to go back. We take him in the next day, and I get a phone call around noon that he can't sleep and I need to take off work to pick him up, (I assume the Tylenol zipped stopped). I take off work, take the next day off to let him heal, and take him back the next week (as this was Thursday). 

About a month later, I get a picture message from her, my son's face bruised again, with the caption ""I guess he didn't learn his lesson the first time."" I once again, take off work and go to get house only to find out that she again tried to teach my son how to walk down the stairs and he slammed his face on the steps and fell to the bottom.

By now I'm literally on fire, and I unleash on her. There was a lot said that I really don't want to repeat, but nonetheless I told her I would be contacting the authorities as she admitted she wasn't watching when he stood on the stairs either time. What I forgot was that her husband was a police officer, and so she filed a restraining order on me and told us we couldn't ever come back to her daycare again.

After a few months pass, we go to file our taxes and they asked if we had a daycare for our son... we told them we did, but switched and the lady said that if we gave her the information they could give us a larger return. At this point, I knew she wouldn't answer me, so I had my friend (whose kid also went to her daycare), call her. After calling, she told him that she didn't claim any of her earnings as profit, and begged him not to use her name while filing taxes. She had been using Venmo to stay under the table, and would venmo the other babysitter who she hired for the week. 

Again, I remind you, we paid 250 a week for daycare- even when our son didn't go to reserve his spot. She has 8 kids there that are not her own, which means she would bring in close to $104,000 a year without taxes! 

What she didn't know was that her husband might be a cop, but my brother in law works for the IRS. It didn't take long to file tax for evasion. She just posted on Facebook complaining about how she got a letter from the government saying she is being audited for the last 3 years, and could she could owe over 75k in taxes to the government. 

I know I might have crossed the line, but I don't feel guilty at all!

TL;DR: Babysitter let my son fall down her stairs TWICE and filed a restraining order against me for losing my cool. I found out she hasn't claimed any income for the last 4 years her daycare has been opened and had the IRS audit her.",ProRevenge,"Neglect my child, I'll make your life a living hell!"

83,ans_89,1597473340,218,1,"I started working for an insurance company in January of this year - I even moved to the opposite side of the country to do so. While i was in office, everything was great; I was hitting my metrics and exceeding goals monthly. Then COVID hit, and we were all sent home to work remotely, that‚Äôs when things went downhill...

In June, my aunt died from COVID so i took time off for the virtual memorial. In July, my wife lost her best friend suddenly and was in the thralls of grief; so i used PTO during this time to cover. The first Sunday of July, I had done a shift trade with a fellow associate but i logged in anyway just to make sure it was accepted. I checked my schedule and the coding for the day was confusing, so i sent my supervisor a screenshot and asked for clarification - it was determined by my sup that i was off that day (this is important for later).

Throughout the month, i noticed that my supervisor was going into my time card and changing my hours work from over 2 months ago, which caused me to ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù use PTO that i didn‚Äôt have (even though the system and my paycheck stated otherwise). Because of her hijacking my time cards regularly, I received EIGHT ATTENDANCE OCCURRENCES in one meeting (we are allowed 8). 

Now remember that day in July where my sup determined i was off? Well, first of August hit and she comes back and tells me that i in fact WAS NOT off that day and ‚Äúnow that I‚Äôm looking at the screenshot, you needed to work.‚Äù She and I went back and forth on what the point of sending information if she wasn‚Äôt even going to look at it; I even reached out to HER supervisor AND HR, but ultimately I was told that this would be the 9th occurrence.

After my sup got wind that I went above her head, she got PISSED! She wouldn‚Äôt recognize my accomplishments but would do so for the rest of the team, she would send me emails that were confusing and started micromanaging EVERYTHING I did; any small mistake would result in IMMEDIATE disciplinary action, even something so small as going over by 1 minute on my break. I‚Äôm on the spectrum, and It was taking a toll on my mental health; I would come into work feeling worthless, no good and in utter terror of losing my job or getting in trouble for something (because up until this point i had gotten in trouble EVERY SINGLE DAY for the last 2 weeks). 

Finally, i came into work on August 3 only to receive an email stating that my sup had ONCE AGAIN manipulated my time card FOR THE DAY OF JUNE 30!!! I didn‚Äôt even think it was legal for a supervisor to go back and change a time card from over a month ago! As a result of this change, i got an email that HR had consequently backdated ALL PTO taken between 6/30 and now due to the change (which was requested directly by my sup).

At this point, I get sent into a meeting with my sup and HER sup. During the meeting, i remained as calm and respectful as possible, all the while trying not to breakdown in tears. I called my supervisor out for time card manipulation, retaliatory behavior, and lack of communication. I even called her out for telling me multiple times to change my time card within a pay period. THIS WOMAN LIED TO HER BOSS‚Äôs FACE, and what‚Äôs worse, she was believed. My character and ethics came into question, to which I was told an investigation would be launched. Long story short, by the end of the meeting and because of her manipulation of my time card, i was at 13 occurrences and was ultimately let go.

The revenge came in just a few hours before the meeting, because what my supervisor didn‚Äôt know is that i had saved EVERY SINGLE EMAIL between me and my sup and screenshot Ted EVERY SKYPE conversation.  the CEO of the company actually responds to emails and has responded to mine every time, so i explained the retaliatory behavior in an email to the CEO, along with ALL the emails and screenshots between me and my sup. I figured it was a long shot, but i wanted to try.

Earlier today, I got a FB message from a former co worker of mine..apparently, my supervisor is no longer there; not quite sure if it‚Äôs admin leave or termination, and the CEO sent out a mass email to the ENTIRE company with updated polices for reporting retaliation and that supervisors are only allowed to update time cards within the last 2 weeks. I was stunned! HAHA! that witch fired me without cause, but i came with receipts and simply returned the favorü§£",ProRevenge,Got my supervisor fired after she retaliated against me and fired me.
84,Ace-VERIFYVENUZ,1597455650,1,1,"Note that this story may not be fully accurate to things I and others have said, this was many months back. I use Discord a lot, there's a server that I am an admin in. However, one of the owners a few months back before I was admin in it invited his 10-year-old younger sister and made it very blatant that she is under 13. I am just going to call him S since his name starts with S and his girlfriend whom defended him A since her name starts with A. S expected all of us to not care and for me to not say anything about it, I spoke up and told him that Discord is 13+. I asked him why he invited his 10-year-old sister. He completely dodged the question and asked me ""Why do you care so much?"". I replied with ""I care because there's an age limit for a reason"". Then here comes Random Guy, he defends it with ""Some people who play COD are under 18"" but of course, this doesn't mean they should. Later Random Guy admits he is also under 13. I go AFK for about 5-10 minutes and they assume it's over with. Now comes his girlfriend A who says ""I think I'm gonna put peacemaker in my roles AHAH"" (calling herself the ""peacemaker"" even though she never really made any peace). I bring it up yet again because this is not my opinion, Discord is 13+ to comply with COPPA (I believe). His girlfriend A then once again defends it by saying ""Ugh just stop talking about it goddamnit"". It makes me mad how they think I won't speak up for age limits. S is also rude and kinda toxic, he trash-talks his friends right in front of them. His little friend group will straight up glorify it. Months after the underage sister incident, I misread ""padded"" (misspelled version of patted) and he just said, ""can u r e a d"". I don't know about you but that's kinda rude. Dude, these people care about you, don't trash-talk them. S also said the f slur and used being LGBTQ+ as an excuse. To be honest, the f slur should never be used. LGBTQ+ or not. Then he cries and whines about me ""attacking"" him for using the f slur when all I said was ""Can you NOT use the f slur?"" (or at least, a good friend of mine told me this, she's an honest person so I believe her). S or someone else later kicked/banned me from the server this occurred in. Probably because I was ""rude"" or ""mean"" even though they support that when Sander is mean and are hypocrites to their own social standards. After this, I had enough. I reported his sister and RG for being underage. I also told Discord how S allowed his underage sister in his Discord server even though he is most likely aware of it being 13+. They are currently investigating the message links I have provided them. I'll let you guys know on this post (not making a separate post) when there's an update and if they got punished. And that is my revenge. Half of the reason I reported them was that I wanted my revenge.",ProRevenge,"Discord is for people 13 and older, your 10 year-old-sister can't use Discord yet."
85,Halicron,1597523248,50,1,"This is a loooooonong story, so buckle in.   
Participants are me, my wife, my youngest son Bill, my oldest son Dean, and my daughter Patricia, and my wife's ex-husband (the Psycho).  
I'm barely scratching the surface here, and I'll TL;DR at the bottom. This story spans about 15 years and includes multiple court cases, lawsuits, the Hague Convention on international parental rights, custody battles, tax fraud, accounts in the Seychelles, and more that I can't even get into for want of time.   
Short version is I met a wonderful woman in a small college town in Montana. When I came into the picture, she was still recovering from her ex husband stealing her two boys away to Asia and then cutting off her access to them. He cleaned out their life savings  and left her totally destitute. He also left a bill from the IRS for the seven years of taxes he had never bothered to file  (well over $100,000). She'd managed to get one son back via the Hague Convention but the other was (by then) legally of an age where he could choose to stay with his dad, and did so. She took her daughter and son to a small college town for him to do high school in one spot. That's where I came into the picture after I met her through a mutual friend.  
To clarify: when I say 'Psycho', I'm talking about someone who has at any given time at least five active lawsuits going against various states, individuals, and corporations. He also once shot and killed their family dog because it wouldn't stop crying, and set fire to a neighbor's garage after the guy pissed him off. He didn't just threaten her, he'd threaten the kids with harm if she stepped out of line. It took my wife a long time to get the courage to leave him because she was afraid of what he'd do to her when she tried.  
I was just back from a deployment to Afghanistan and needed a place to stay, so I sublet a room from her. I enjoyed having actual home-cooked meals again, and she felt like her son Bill needed a decent male role model around. I bonded really quickly with Bill, her/our youngest. He and I got along great. His one blind spot was his dad and his brother. About 18 months after I met his mom, Dean and Psycho show up in our small college town in Montana to 'save' Bill from us (he was turning 18, so it wasn't exactly an act of courageous intervention so much as 'hey living with your mom must suck, let's get an apartment and party all the time). She had no idea of this plan until she saw Psycho randomly at a local shopping center. When she called me in a panic because Psycho was in town, we swung right into action.  
We armed her up, locked down the house, and started burning the candle at both ends with lawyers from all over the country. Psycho lives like a ghost, pays cash for everything, ID expired, lives month to month in trailers, etc. He's off-the-grid as it's possible to get, despite having pending judgments from FIVE different states.  
This was the first time in years anyone knew \*exactly\* where he was. We had to take advantage of this opportunity.  
My sister-in-law had previously sued him for defamation, and won a hefty cash settlement that he'd never paid. My wife had also sued him for substantial back child support, which never materialized. There were a few other folks and state agencies who had grievances against him. We talked to them all. Once we got everything in order, I staked out the small downtown area until I spotted him, then tailed him to a coffee shop. I had a proces server on standby not far away (who was very excited to serve papers on an asshole like this and happily waived his hourly rate while waiting on my call).   
Psycho got served with \*everything\*. Civil judgements, criminal charges, attorney fees, notice for unpaid taxes, you name it. These were from other states, and they wouldn't extradite for a contempt thing, but it meant if he ever got arrested or detained in his home state, he'll face jail time. She also requested a restraining order in Montana so he could not approach her or get within 500 yards of her.   
We couldn't get him on the other stuff (extradition's not something most states will deal with outside of felony offenses). But we did make him appear for the restraining order. He's the sort of arrogant ass who thinks he's smarter and better prepared than anyone in the room. So he showed up thinking that the court would be a great platform for trying to intimidate his ex on the witness stand and show the boys that he was right all along.  
Among other things, my wife is extremely detail-oriented. She had kept every threatening letter, every hateful email, every mocking text message. Years of emails between him and his (then) under-age kids. A copy of the Hague Declaration. We had even printed out the entire 50 page manifest of the website he maintained, which was basically just a long tirade about how his 'crazy ex wife was completely obsessed with him'. It was a couple of reams worth of evidence to sort through, so we did.    
\*I\* am very good at analyzing huge chunks of information like that. So I took a few hundred pages of his written words and distilled it down to ten pages. I called it 'Psycho's Greatest Hits'.   
He showed up to court in jeans and a T-shirt with the two boys; we showed up with my daughter, my daughter's fiancee, and our lawyer. And we fucking \*wrecked\* him in court. Evidence, meticulously collated and filed. Evidence to support the evidence. Precise timelines and a full accounting of events. Our lawyer eviscerated him on examination. He blustered and panicked and our lawyer got him to confess to hidden income, to intentionally violating parental rights rules, and defiance of custody orders. (We used his own testimony in a civil suit later to up the damages he owed us well into the seven-figure territory).  
My wife was terrified of Psycho trying to examine her on the stand. We'd prepped her for days, making sure she was ready. Up until the first question, she was still scared and not sure how she'd respond. Then he started talking and you could \*see\* the steel going into her backbone. She wasn't scared-- she was mad. He opened up with his first question, trying to gaslight her off the bat: 

""Wasn't it true that when we met, you were failing out of college?""   
""No.""  
She stares him down-- I'd never seen her look that angry. He fumbles-- and then HE BLINKS FIRST.  
""... uh er... but... yes you were.""  
""Objection!""  
She stood up to him like a boss and made him look like a fumbling moron for the whole of examination. He could not fathom how to deal with someone he couldn't bully or gaslight anymore. Even when counsel objected to his questions, she'd answer them anyway because she wanted it on record, \*under oath\*, that the story he was spinning to the boys had been-- and always was-- a lie. And she nailed it.   
(I got some fun in myself; the judge was an Air Force general and I was an Army vet. When Psycho started bragging about his eighteen month stint in the Navy as a barnacle scraper, we shared A Look and I \*knew\* he could also smell shit on the story. I also went across the aisle during recess to talk to the boys, just friendly and convivial as could be to show there were no hard feelings. I plopped my ass on Psycho's paperwork with my back to him the whole time. He just sat there and sulked).  
We get awarded a 'no contact' order, because there's no specific threat of violence it's hard to argue for a full restraining order. The judge clearly really hated how he was hampered from actually laying something punitive on Psycho because of the lack of any prior successful criminal convictions. So he leans over the stand and says 'Mr. Psycho, let me be very clear: I would have you thrown in jail if the law allowed. There is only one person in this courtroom who is trying to cause grief, and it's you. You are a poor example of a man and a father. And if I see you in my courtroom again for bothering this woman, I will personally see to it that you see jail time.'  
A few weeks later, Psycho manages to persuade the boys to request a no-contact on \*us\*.   
THE SAME JUDGE WAS PRESIDING. He recognized the family name and said 'I am not going to sit here and listen to a bunch of manufactured bullshit. You two are clearly dancing at the end of someone else's line. I thought you two were smarter than this.' He denied the order, but we did respect Bill's request that we not contact him.   
I'm generally a law-abiding person, but the one time I broke the law was to go to Bill's high-school graduation. I told him I wanted to see him cross the stage, and I had his mom and sister and they'd like to sit in the way back. He agreed to let us do it. That was the last we saw of him for a while.   
 (This is also the point in time where my wife and I went from being 'close platonic friends' to being romantically involved, but that's another story).   
SMASHCUT TO 18 MONTHS LATER:  


We've moved to Bozeman and rented a really nice house, just the two of us. Our daughter's married and living in Portland. I assured my now-wife things would work out, and we made the best of having the house to ourselves. ;)   
Then I get a phone call from \*my\* dad:   
""Hey I met your son the other day.""  
""What?""  
""Bill, right?""  
""Uh... yeah? He's still up north though.""  
""No, he's here in Bozeman! You know my best friend from college, Kevin? He's dating Kevin's  daughter Gracie.""  
(Kevin was 'Uncle Kevin' to me when I was very little, and his son and I have been friends literally our whole lives. Gracie was a very late-in-life oopsie who came into the picture about 20 years later).  
So I call Kevin and we talk. NOT ONLY IS HE HOSTING BILL, DEAN CAME DOWN TO BOZEMAN TOO. Kevin's the sort of man who mentors and molds young men. He's done more than a few reclamation projects over the years. He tells me how much he likes them, and I give him a less adulterated version of the events of the last decade. We find out that Bill had a MAJOR falling out with Psycho over how Psycho treated Gracie (shockingly, Psycho's also a misogynist dick). Also, Bill wanted to join the Marines, and Psycho tried to forbid him from doing it. Bill told Psycho to go f\*\*k himself and moved out of their apartment. After Psycho and Bill moved away, Dean followed his brother to Bozeman and rented a house less than a mile from where my wife and I were living.  
At this time, my wife's dad is very sick. I get word to Bill through Kevin that if he wants to see his grandad one more time, he needs to do it now. My wife stays at home for Bill's visit to the nursing home, but I am there to mediate things. Bill and his grandad talk for about an hour and his grandad's literal dying wish is that Bill finds a way to reconcile with his mom. During their talk, I get to set the record straight with Kevin regarding The Story so far.  
Six months later, Bill's grandad is dying. No one knows how to get a hold of Bill because he's in Basic Training and has very limited phone privileges. I send a Red Cross message to him (figuring if he decides to be serious about the no contact, I'm the only one who gets in trouble).   
Bill doesn't call me, or the nursing home, or Kevin. He calls his mom. They talk for a long time and the phone call ends with him asking us to come to his graduation from Basic Training. At this point it's most of two years since my wife saw him. He's a different man than when we saw him last, and it shows on his face. And he is 100% resolved to put things behind him and make amends with his mom and they just hug the hell out of each other for a solid minute when we show up. We bring Kevin and Gracie with us and we have a little family reunion.   
It gets better though. Dean is still around. He's not sure what to do with himself. He wants to keep the fight against his mom going but his dad dipped out of Bozeman so Dean is going to school, working a part-time job, and also trying to keep up an exhausting hate campaign on his dad's behalf. Now, \*Gracie\* decides to get involved. Gracie is sneakier than all of us put together and decides to bully Dean into having a family again. We hatch plans to start bringing Dean back into the fold. It's mostly me taking him and Bill shooting, going to the movies, etc. Dean gets invited to every family meal at Gracie's, and as a starving college student he's not going to turn down a hot meal just because his mom is gonna be there. It's a little awkward, but everyone handles it so gracefully. He gets a little friendly teasing about it and no one lets him get away with being a dick.  
This all culminates with Bill getting married to Gracie (best DIL ever, y'all). The last big hurdle for Dean is coming into \*our\* home, which we bought from my wife's parents when they moved into assisted living. Dean spent a lot of summers there as a baby so there's some real mixed feelings about it for him.   
It's the day before Bill's wedding to Gracie. I'm wrangling the groomsmen around, and we don't really give Dean a choice; we drive to my house and get out of the car and head inside. Bill and all the groomsmen are in on the plan. Dean's hesitating on the front steps, not quite sure what he's going to do. Like he's not sure if someone's going to pick a fight or if he will be welcome in there. I clap him on the shoulder with a smile and say, ""Dean, I'm only going to say this once. This is Bill's day. Don't ruin it by being a little bitch. Go inside, hug your mom, then we're all gonna smoke cigars and drink whisky on the back porch like a family.""  
And that's what we did.  
That's when the levee really broke. Dean started coming around to the house more often for family game night, then dropping by on his own. We always fed him well and sent him home with leftovers. He started asking me for advice with life stuff, trying to fill in the blanks where Psycho had given him a bad turn of advice. Then he started reconnecting with his mom again.   
I knew Dean had fully flipped the script, come Thanksgiving. He blows in the door like Kramer with a big grin on his face, the stress on his face going from 100% to 0% in just a few steps. He admitted to me later that he'd spent the early part of the day with Psycho, watching his old man try to hustle his Veteran status for a free Thanksgiving meal at a diner. I repeated what his mom had always said: 'We're always here when you're ready to come back'. We had him back 100%.   
But it gets better.  
Dean's the sort of person who can't set a problem aside, and once he commits to a solution, he is in 100%. See, Psycho didn't just enlist Dean's verbal support in his schemes. He made Dean do a lot of the work. The legal paperwork, the defamatory letters and websites, the lawsuits, all of it.   
Dean goes scorched earth. The thesis-size website defaming my wife and the extended family? Dean destroys it, trashes the backups, and scrubs all the accounts. All the encrypted email accounts? Contents archived, stored offline, and then deleted. The various lawsuits? Forfeited and declared abandoned. He systematically demolishes a decade worth of slander, libel, and legal hell that Psycho had put everyone through, leaving his old man \*completely\* out in the cold.  
The icing on an already perfect cake-- Dean admits he's been 'handling' the money for Psycho.  Apparently, Psycho was so paranoid about the government that he made Dean the primary account holder for all those offshore accounts and all the gold investments. Psycho lost a pretty good amount of the money to shady overseas investment firms, but Dean managed to protect a lot of it. I don't know how much, and I don't want to know how much. He tells me this because he feels a little guilty about having the money. It's not like we need it; my wife and I are out of the red thanks to her hard work and \*extremely\* successful career. I advise him to use it however he sees fit. I can't imagine anyone else would be more responsible with it than him.  
So he buys an 'investment property' south of town, and it just so happens that it's \*perfect\* for his struggling, newly divorced sister and her horses. She rents it at a very modest rate, keeps an eye on the house, and the rest of us are doing improvements and maintenance on it. Now he's off on his own adventure as a military officer in a very prestigious, \*very\* selective engineering program. My daughter owns her own business working with horses and my youngest son is an NCO and a real rising star in his division. The family's well and whole again, and it's because we always told the boys that no matter what, when they were ready to come back, the door would be open. 

Tl;DR: Ten years ago, we had no idea where either of our sons were after their psychopath father estranged them from the rest of the family. My wife was getting out of an abusive relationship and under a mountain of debt. Now one son is a Marine sergeant and happily married, and the other is an engineering officer. Their psycho father doesn't have a wife, the money he stole, or any family who talks to him.  We have an amazing family and we've never been closer. My wife has her sons back and I'm the one who gets cards on Father's Day. We've never been happier, and it's proof that the best revenge is sometimes just a life well-lived.",ProRevenge,Revenge 15 years in the making.

They looked like they knew what they were doing so we took it serious. We decided to get revenge on the best way possible. We knew we would have to wait in the parking lot for the food to come out so not only did we steal his food but we gave them our food. We ordered 10 plain buns with pickles on the side. We are about to get our food but we say wrong order and get his food he knows he got our food but did not know what we ordered. We hear a faint yell in the distance ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SH!T‚Äù hopefully knowing what we did.",ProRevenge,Someone tried to steal my food
